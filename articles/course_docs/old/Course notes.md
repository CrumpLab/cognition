Skills

This course is designed to help you develop useful skills while you learn about cognitive psychology. There are many ways to get an A, or any other grade that you desire. All of the assignments are designed to engage you in an activity that will develop your skills. This course is about what you do in it, and it rewards you for taking the time and effort to engage in the course materials and assignments yourself. There is one very simple rule: Do your own work. You will find many options in this course, feel free to choose the ones that make you most excited, interested, and engaged. All assignments, unless stated otherwise, are individual assignments to be done by yourself.

You will find quizzes, exams, and many other kinds of alternative assignments that you can use to get points toward a grade in this course. These are all designed to engage you in various aspects of cognitive psychology.

This course does not reward students who understand and nevertheless violate the academic integrity policy. Students who violate the policy will be reported, and the typical sanction is automatic fail in the course.

All instructors at Brooklyn College are mandated to report suspected violations of the academic integrity policy.

What happens to students in this course that are suspected of violating the academic integrity policy?

First, and foremost, I expect students to understand the academic integrity policy and hold themselves to a high standard of personal and academic integrity in this course. Second, this course contains a learning module that explains the academic integrity policy, and students are required to affirm their understanding of the policy, and acknowledge the consequences of violating it. As a result, violations of the academic integrity policy that occur during the course are considered egregious, and will be sanctioned accordingly.

If I obtain credible evidence of a suspected violation, then I am mandated to report the violation and assign sanctions. With few exceptions, students will receive a FAR report and immediately fail the class with an F.

1. I will file a faculty action report (FAR) for each student with the academic integrity office (NO EXCEPTIONS). The FAR report will remain on each student's personal file at the academic integrity office. Violations of academic integrity will be noted on your UNOFFICIAL transcript. Students who have multiple FAR reports filed against them may receive additional sanctions, such as expulsion. Students can appeal FAR reports, and information about the appeals process is available from the academic integrity office.

2. I will apply a sanction of F for the course. In rare circumstances students may receive a different sanction. In all circumstances, the FAR report will be filed at the academic integrity office. Students who are sanctioned with an F for violating the academic integrity policy can NOT replace the F using F-grade replacement. The F will remain on your transcript and it will affect your GPA.

3. I will communicate with students and be as transparent as possible about suspected academic violations. It is possible to further violate academic integrity principles during the communication process. These further violations will be noted, and result in an immediate F in the course.
