**Course objectives**: develop the following skills in relation to content learning objectives in 2530:

| Goal                                                                                                                                                      | Learning Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Exposure to breadth of theory and data across major domains of cognition (listed above)                                                               | Students will demonstrate ability to identify and describe domain-specific theories and phenomena                                                                                                                  |
| 2\. Understanding deduction from theory, which requires an understanding of the assumptions of a theory and how they combine to force a clear prediction. | Students will demonstrate the ability to describe in written format the assumptions of a domain-specific theory along to show how the theory demands a prediction.                                                 |
| 3\. Understanding experimental design                                                                                                                     | Students will demonstrate working knowledge of the elements of particular experimental designs that create opportunity to test a theoretical idea                                                                  |
| 4\.

| 5\. Understanding inference from results to theory                                                                                                        | Students will demonstrate the ability to form an inference about an observed result, and display the ability to evaluate whether or not a result conforms to a prediction made by a theory in cognitive psychology |

## Course Materials

All of the course materials will be available in a timely fashion on this course website and/or posted on blackboard.

Link to the course website: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/>

## Blackboard

In addition to the course website, Blackboard be will be used heavily throughout the semester.

Blackboard will be used for course announcements, discussion boards, and for students to submit their assignments.

**It is essential that students make sure their email address is correctly registered with Blackboard. Blackboard announcements will be sent to students at their registered email address.**

## Course Structure

This is an asynchronous online course consisting of weekly learning modules and assessments. There are 15 total weeks involving learning modules and/or general assessments. Learning modules and assessments provide opportunities for students to earn up to 100 points toward their final grade. 

There are many different assignments and most of them are optional. As a result, students have many ways to accrue points toward their grade. Students are encouraged to choose assignments that they find most interesting and engaging. 

### Learning module structure

Weekly learning modules include three components to encourage engagement with the domain of cognitive psychology in different ways.

**READ**: Modules have assigned readings from textbook chapters or primary research articles. Readings are freely available and posted on blackboard or the course website. 

**WATCH/LISTEN**:  Modules will have mini-lecture videos with overviews of the readings. The videos and slides will be posted on the course website. 

**ENGAGE**: Modules include assignments for students to engage with course material. Assignments vary and there is flexibility for students to choose which assignments they complete.

## Course Schedule

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#library(data.table)
library(readxl)
Lectures <- read_excel("Fall_2023_schedule.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = "", skip = 0)
Lectures$Week <- as.character(Lectures$Week)
Lectures[is.na(Lectures)] <- " "
#Lectures <- fread("Lectures.csv")
knitr::kable(Lectures)

```

## Assignments, Assessments, and Grading

There are multiple ways for students to engage with course materials and achieve their desired grade. Students are encouraged to choose the assignments that work best for them. Major course assessments that occur throughout the semester are designed to help students set and achieve their own goals for engaging in course content.

### Assignments

Each weekly module contains two or more assignment opportunities. In general, quizzes are worth 2.5 points and other assignments are worth 5 points. Some assignments are required even though they are not worth any points, such as those in the getting started module.

Unless otherwise noted, students can choose which quizzes or assignments to complete for a given module. Across the semester, students can complete as many quizzes or assignments as they want, for a maximum of 85 points toward their final grade. 

In addition to the weekly assignments, which focus on the details of module content, there are opportunities to complete other more general assignments. These general assignments are listed on the website, and have their own tab on blackboard.

In collaboration with the instructor, students follow a process of self-assessment to recommend how many points should be awarded for their own assignments (not including quizzes). The self-assessment process is used as a guide toward goal setting and achievement in the course.

### Discussion Boards

There will be opportunity to gain points through participation in discussion boards on Blackboard. See instructions on blackboard for individual discussion boards.

### Assessments

There are three major assessments throughout the semester culminating in a final assessment conducted during final exam week. These assessments are used as an aid toward goal-setting and achievement in the course. The first two assessments focus on goal-setting and goal refinement with respect to engaging in course material. The final assessment focuses on goal-achievement, and feedback with respect to engaging in course material. Unless otherwise stated all major course assessments are conducted in person during regular class time (or during the scheduled final exam period). Bring a pen or pencil.

### Points and letter grades

| Assignment        | Points |    Total |
|:------------------|-------:|---------:|
| 12 Weekly Modules |     5+ | up to 85 |
| Assessment 1      |      5 |        5 |
| Assessment 2      |      5 |        5 |
| Final Assessment  |      5 |        5 |
|                   |        |      100 |

Percentage grades are converted to letter grades according to the following rubric.

| Letter grade | Range       |
|:-------------|:------------|
| A+           | 96.67-100   |
| A            | 93.33-96.66 |
| A-           | 90-93.32    |

| C+           | 76.67-79.99 |
| C            | 73-76.66    |
| C-           | 70-72.99    |
| D+           | 66.67-69.99 |
| D            | 63.33-66.66 |
| D-           | 60-63.32    |
| F            | 0-59.99     |

### Lateness and due dates

This is an asynchronous course that allows you some flexibility to work on the material according to your own schedule. However, there are also due dates, and expectations that you will be completing coursework on a weekly basis. You may be able to work ahead, but you are not encouraged to fall behind.

Each of the assignments, quizzes, and assessments will be posted with a due date. A quiz or assignment will be open for a week-long period, and the work is expected to be completed within the assigned time frame. Late assignments may not be graded.


## Honors Projects

It is possible to complete an honors project and receive honors credit for this course. Please see the [honors project page](https://crumplab.com/cognition/articles/honors/honors.html) for more information.

## Course Policies

### Changes to the syllabus

The syllabus may be updated for clarity or to make adjustments for pedagogical purposes. The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.

### Individual versus group work

All assigned work is individual work unless otherwise stated. **Therefore, you should complete all coursework by yourself.** Make sure you understand the University's policy on Academic Integrity, described below. Any assignment that is not an individual assignment will be clearly labeled.

### Using ChatGPT or similar tools in this course

ChatGPT and other similar tools have been trained on large amount of text from the internet. These tools are capable of generating text that is similar in style to the text the models have been trained on. They are also capable of fabricating complete nonsense. This section describes allowable use cases for this course. This course does not require use of this software, and does not particularly encourage it.

1. **If you use ChatGPT as an aid in one of your your assignments, then you are required to explain how you used the tool at the end of your assignment.**

2.  It is okay to explore the technology: how it works, how you might use it as a tool, and the very real issues surrounding this technology for society.

3.  Do not rely on this technology being there for free. It is new and it could easily be pulled off the internet at anytime. It costs a lot of money to run the models, and businesses are looking for ways to monetize their product. 

4.  Passing off work from ChatGPT as your own is a violation of academic integrity that will be taken very seriously (see the notes on academic integrity in the following sectdion). 

**I care about what you have to say, not what ChatGPT has to say.**

#### Acceptable use cases

This is not an exhaustive list. If you think the way you used the tool was appropriate, then all you have to do is explain why when you submit the assignment.

It is best to treat ChatGPT like a chaotic assistant that sometimes completes a task up to your standard. Don't trust the results. ChatGPT does not produce accurate text, it produces text that "looks" like it is in right style. Sometimes the results are accurate, many times they are not.

1. Asking ChatGPT to spell and grammar check your own writing. I've done this myself and it sometimes helps. It regularly produces suggestions that I don't accept, so be careful. Say what you want to say.

2. Help turn notes into a paragraph. Give ChatGPT some notes in point form and ask it to turn the points into a paragraph. Then, use the paragraph as a starting point for your own writing process

3. Summarize something. Ask ChatGPT to summarize text into point form. 

#### Unacceptable use cases

This is not an exhaustive list of unacceptable use cases that violate academic integrity principles.

1. Submitting an assignment prompt to ChatGPT and handing in ChatGPT's response as your own writing. 

2. Copying another source that you are plagiarizing, having ChatGPT rewrite it to appear different, and then handing the response in as your own writing.


### Missing an Exam

In the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar's website. See also the student bereavement policy at <http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Accessibility

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Email Correspondence

I will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.

If you have questions please email me:

1.  put PSYC 2530 in your subject line
2.  email me at: mcrump\@brooklyn.cuny.edu

### General Help with Research and Writing

The Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at [Research & Writing Help](https://library.brooklyn.cuny.edu/resources/?service=research-help). The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing <http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/>.

The best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people---classmates, teachers, friends---or texts---books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly---or, even unwittingly---resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources---read the information on the following website carefully: <http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/>. The bottom line is: passing off anyone's words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism.

## Violations of Academic integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to understand and act in accordance with the University's policy on Academic Integrity, described below.

### University's policy on Academic Integrity

The faculty and administration of Brooklyn College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found at [this site](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives.php). If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.

### Commitment to uphold standards of academic integrity

The most important thing you can do in this course is complete the work with integrity. This means engaging with the course content and doing the work yourself. The more that you do this, the more you will get out of the course. 

You are responsible for reading and understanding the CUNY's [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/). You are responsible maintaining your own academic integrity in this course. By enrolling in this course, and by participating in it, you are committed to upholding these standards. 

### Examples of academic integrity violations

The above link lists many examples of behavior like cheating and plagiarism that are violations of the academic integrit policy. The following is a non-exhaustive list of specific acts that you should NOT do because they would violate the academic integrity policy. Any of these are sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.

-   Do not take pictures or copy exam or quiz questions and share them with other students, or share them on the internet
-   Do not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment
-   Do not copy work from another source and submit it as your own, this includes using tools like ChatGPT to generate text. Copying text from ChatGPT or another similar tool and submitting it as your own work violates academic integrity policies in this course.
-   Do not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words
-   Do not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own
-   Do not hire someone else to do the coursework for you
-   Do not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work
-   Do not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.
-   Do not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.
-   Do not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.

### Mandate to report violations

If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.

There is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office.
