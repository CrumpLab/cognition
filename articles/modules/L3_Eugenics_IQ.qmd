### L3 Writing 1: The formation of ABPSi

This assignment involves reading a paper about the formation of the Association of Black Psychologists and a writing activity. The citation for the paper is:

Williams, R. (1974). A History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Early Formation and Development. Journal of Black Psychology, 1(1), 9–24.

You can obtain the paper through the library, or download it from this assignment on blackboard.

This is a fairly open-ended writing assignment. Your task is to read the paper, and then describe what you learned from the paper in at least 250 words using full sentences (feel free to write more if you want).

Submit your writing to this assignment posted on blackboard.

5 points

This assignment will be graded pass/fail, with a possibility of partial points. I am looking for evidence that you engaged in the reading and writing process with your own voice.


### L3 Writing 2: APA's apology

In October 2021, the American Psychological Association issued an apology to People of Color for APA’s Role in Promoting, Perpetuating, and Failing to Challenge Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Human Hierarchy in U.S.

<https://www.apa.org/about/policy/racism-apology>

The above website contains the apology, and additional information providing context for the apology. 

This is a fairly open-ended writing assignment. Your task is to visit and read through the above website. Then describe what you learned from this process in at least 200 words using full sentences (feel free to write more if you want). Submit your writing to this assignment posted on blackboard.

5 points

This assignment will be graded pass/fail, with a possibility of partial points. I am looking for evidence that you engaged in the reading and writing process. I am not expecting you to read and memorize the entire website. Use your own discretion on how much time you put into reviewing the material, and direct your own reading towards points of interest that you may want to write about.

### L3 Writing 3: Contributions of ABPSi to psychology

This is review paper from 2018 discussing contributions of the field of Black/African psychology from the last 50 years. If you are unfamiliar with this field of psychology it is an excellent review. Note, the first assignment focuses on the formation of the ABPsi in the 1970s. This paper reviews contributions since then.

The citation for the paper is:

Cokley, K., & Garba, R. (2018). Speaking Truth to Power: How Black/African Psychology Changed the Discipline of Psychology. Journal of Black Psychology, 44(8), 695–721.

The paper is available as a download from this assignment on Blackboard.

Your task is to read the paper and pick out one or two (or more) issues that you found informative. Explain what the issues are AND explain why you personally found them informative. Your assignment should be at least 250 words using full sentences (feel free to write more if you want).
