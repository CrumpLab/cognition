### Hick-Hyman law

The textbook chapter discussed choice reaction time experiments and the Hick-Hyman law. Your writing assignment is to explain the following:

1. Describe what the set-size effect refers to in a choice-reaction time experiment.

2. Describe what the Hick-Hyman law refers to.

3. Explain the repetition priming confound, and describe how repetition priming could explain performance in choice-reaction time tasks showing evidence of the Hick-Hyman law. (Hint review section 7.8.7.4 in the textbook)
