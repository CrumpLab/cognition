Reading is Chapter 9 on [Memory I](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/memory-ii.html)

Quiz 6 is open until Thursday @ 11:59pm

##  Measuring Memory

## Measuring Meory

Memory processes and abilities are measured with memory tasks

Memory tasks are imperfect, and do not necessarily directly measure a memory process

## Recall vs recognition

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

**Recall task**

Encoding phase: view a list of items (usually words)

Recall phase: generate as many items from the list as possible (e.g., write down as many words as you can remember)

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

**Recognition task**

Encoding phase: view a list of items (usually words)

Recognition phase: view one item at a time, judge whether the item is OLD or NEW

(old items were presented before, and new items are not presented)

:::
::::

## Recall task performance

Does failing to recall an item mean you don't have a memory for it?


## Recognition task performance

Does near 100% accuracy on a recognition memory test mean you have good memory for the old items?


##  Memory Phenomena

### 1. Measuring Memory {.greyout}
### 2. Memory Phenomena {.bolder}
### 3. Memory Principles {.greyout}

## Memory Phenomena

Memory phenomena are experimental findings showing how some manipulation influences performance in a memory task

Examples:

Ebbinghaus showed manipulations of temporal delay influence forgetting

Von Restorff showed that manipulations of distinctiveness influence recall performance

## Many Memory Phenomena

The textbook reviews several examples of findings that are known to influence memory performance, let's review some of them

## Picture Superiority effect

## Presentation Rate and Spacing

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

The encoding phase varied how long participants viewed each word, and used presentation rates of 1.3, 2.3, and 4.3 seconds.

Repetitions were separated, or spaced out, by 0, 2, 4, 8, 20, or 40 intervening words.
