##  Questions about memory

What is it like for you to remember something from your past? 

How many events from your experience can you remember? 

Why can you remember something from years ago, but forget new information from seconds ago? 

How do you preserve your experiences so that they can be remembered later on? 

Why is it sometimes hard to remember something, but later the answer pops in your head? 

How can you improve your memory?

How can you forget things you don’t want to think about? 

What other animals besides humans have memories? 

How are memories encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain? 

How do people use their environment to help them remember things?

## Early memory researchers

Hermann Ebbinghaus

Sir Frederick Bartlett

Bluma Zeigarnik

Hedwig von Restorff

## Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850-1909)

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Conducted some of the first experimental investigations of human memory

1885 - english translation from German, "[Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology](https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft)"

```

:::
::::

## What did Ebbinghaus do?

Systematically measured rates of learning and forgetting

Conducted single-subject research on himself

Invented use of nonsense material (CVC syllables)

## Big Questions

How do people learn new associations?

What happens to new learning with delays between practice? (forgetting)

## Issues

People already have many existing associations from their experience...

How to study learning of new associations?

## Methodological insight

Adopt a task with very little pre-existing familiarity

Ebbinghaus devised a serial learning task to measure how long it took to recite of a list of items from memory. 

He used artificial stimuli so that pre-existing familiarity with the items would not interfere with the learning process. 

## Nonsense syllables

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/CVC_table.png")
```

## Ebbinghaus's task

Ebbinghaus' task involved learning lists of nonsense syllables

Two basic phases:

1. Learning phase

2. Re-learning after a delay


## Modern Replication

Murre, J. M. J., & Dros, J. (2015). Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve. PLOS ONE, 10(7), e0120644. https://doi.org/f7vfcn

## one-time perfect

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Learning phase: practice reciting a row until it is recited perfectly one time, then move to next row

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/CVC_table.png")
```

:::
::::

## Re-learning after delay

In the second phase, each row was re-learned after a delay. The delays were 20 minutes, 1 hour, 9 hours, or 1, 2, 6, or 31 days.

After each delay period, rows were shown again and relearned. 

The number of relearning attempts to get to another “one-time perfect” recitation was also measured.

## Original learning

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

How many practice attempts were necessary to memory a row of nonsense syllables?

The blue line shows that an average of 30-32 practice attempts were needed to memorize each row

## Savings in Re-learning

How many attempts were required to re-learn a list after different delays?

The delays were 20 minutes, 1 hour, 9 hours, or 1, 2, 6, or 31 days.

## Results

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/murre_dros_2015.png")
```

## Exponential forgetting

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Ebbinghaus was the first show evidence for exponential forgetting across delays

Most forgetting occurred immediately after learning, and the rate of forgetting slowed down as delay increased

"Exponential forgetting is like going to Las Vegas and spending most of your money on the first day, and then losing the rest of it slowly over the next week."

## Sir Frederick Bartlett (1886-1969)

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

British Psychologist

Published book "Remembering" in 1932

Reconstructionist view of memory

## Memory metaphors

1. Memory is a file drawer

2. Memory is a camera

3. Memory is a bent-wire

## Memory as "RE-" Membering

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Memory is "Humpty-Dumpty"

Memory as a process of re-constructing, or actively putting back together 

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/Humpty_dumpty.jpg")
```

:::
::::

## Big questions

How do people reconstruct a prior memory?

How does memory change over successive re-memberings?

## Method of Serial Reproduction

Bartlett conducted experiments that involves two general phases:

1. Encoding/learning of some information

2. Reproduction phases: Had people reproduce the information from memory, many times over

## L'Portraite D'homme

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../../textbook/imgs/Bartlett_homme.png")
```

## Bartlett's Schemas

Bartlett suggested that remembering processes are guided by general schemas

People may distort their original experiences toward a schema

## Reproducing Bartlett

Carbon, C.-C., & Albrecht, S. (2012). Bartlett’s schema theory: The unreplicated “portrait d’homme” series from 1932. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 65(11), 2258–2270. https://doi.org/gjs5bh

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/Barteltt_replication.jpg")
```

## Memory distortions

Although some of Bartlett’s findings may not stand the test of time, there are many reproducible findings showing that memory can be distorted in interesting ways. 

So, even though memory reconstruction may not always head toward a schema, memory does appear to involve some kind of constructive process capable of returning accurate and distorted impressions of past experiences.


## Bluma Zeigarnik (1901-1988)

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Early memory researcher

"to-do" list effect

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/Zeigarnick.jpg")
```

:::
::::

## Phenomenon

Zeigarnik investigated an apparent phenomenon showing that uncompleted tasks are remembered better than completed tasks

## Method

Participants were given a variety of tasks that took about 3- 5 minutes to complete (math, drawing, threading a needle).

Manipulation:

Partway through some of the tasks, she interrupted people and asked them to start on a new task. 

At the end of the experiment, the participants had completed some of the tasks, and others remained incomplete.

## Results

Zeigarnik then had participants recall all of the tasks. 

Across several experiments she reliably found that people recalled more of the uncompleted tasks than the completed tasks. 

One explanation was the goal to a complete a task created psychological tension that could only be resolved by completing the task. This goal-based tension is not resolved when a task is interrupted, and leads to differences in memory completed and uncompleted tasks.

## Replication attempts

In 1968, Van Bergen published several replication attempts and found that her participants did not show systematic differences in their memory for completed and uncompleted tasks...


## Hedwig von Restorff (1906-1962)

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Applied Gestalt theory figure/ground concepts to memory

Demonstrated role of distinctiveness in memory

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/vonRestorff.jpg")
```

:::
::::

## Big Questions

What makes some information more memorable than others?

Is memory better for things that "stand-out" from the background?

## Method

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Tested recall memory for lists of paired items.

Manipulated:

"massed" items (CVC syllables) vs

"isolated" items (unique pairs)

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../../textbook/imgs/Von_restorff_Stimuli.png")
```

:::
::::

## Counterbalancing

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Counterbalancing is an experimental technique used to control for the role of individual stimuli

Von Restorff counterbalanced the massed and isolated items across lists


:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../../textbook/imgs/Von_Restorff_counterbalance.jpg")
```

:::
::::

## Results

Von Restorff found:

Higher recall of isolated pairs compared to massed pairs...

Regardless of type of material

Important: particular stimuli were more or less memorable, not in and of themselves, but in relation to how distinct they were from other stimuli in the set.

## Distinctiveness effects

..have been replicated many times in many ways since von Restorff
