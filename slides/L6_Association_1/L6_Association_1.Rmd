## Precursors to Experimental Psychology

- Philosophy and Associationism
- Natural Science
- Evolution

## Philosophy

For many centuries before Psychology, questions about cognition were posed by philosophers

## Epistemology

The branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge...

What is knowledge? How do we know something?

## Rationalism

## Empiricism

## The Associationist School

## Principles of Association

## Putting the claims to the test

Associationist claims are specific enough that they can be evaluated with evidence. As a result, it becomes possible to use the scientific method to assess claims about associations and cognition.

Some basic claims include:

1. People have associations between concepts

2. New associations can be learned

3. Some associations are stronger than others

##  Cattell's Associations

### 1. Philosophy and Associationism {.greyout}
### 2. Cattell's Associations {.bolder}
### 3. Thorndike's Puzzle Boxes {.greyout}
### 4. Pavlov's Classical Conditioning {.greyout}

## Cattell's Experimental Psychology

James McKeen Cattell (early mental tester) also conducted experimental psychology research

General goal was to use experiments to test theories of cognitive processes, especially those related to the formation of associations

## Mental Chronometry

Mental chronometry involves measuring the amount of time necessary to complete a task or mental operation

## Naming Time research

Cattell, J. M. (1886). The time it takes to see and name objects. Mind, 11(41), 63â€“65. https://doi.org/10/b6fr5r
