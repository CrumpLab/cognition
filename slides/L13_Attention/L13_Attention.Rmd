# What is Attention?

> Everybody knows what attention is... - William James

# What is Attention?

- How we prioritize our mental resources
- How we select relevant from irrelevant information
- How we focus
- How we ignore

# Metaphors of attention

There are different perspectives on the kinds of processes that are involved in attention abilities

Theories of attention use a variety of metaphors

# Spotlight Metaphor

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

>- Attention acts like a spotlight

>- Attention shines "extra" cognitive resources on selected information

>- Attention highlights attended information

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

```{r}

# Filter Metaphor

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

>- Attention acts like a filter

>- Attention prevents unwanted information from further cognitive processing

# Attentional Distinctions

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

**Endogenous Attention**

>- Internal "orienting" of attention
>- Voluntary decision to attend to some information and not others

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

**Exogenous Attention**

>- External "orienting" of attention
>- Some stimuli automatically cause people to attend to them (e.g., loud noises)

# Controlled vs automatic influences

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

**Controlled**

>- Effortful
>- Voluntary
>- Deliberate
>- usually resource limited
>- slow

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

**Automatic**

>- Effortless
>- fast, rapid, ballistic
>- Involuntary

# Attentional Theory

There are multiple theoretical frameworks for understanding attention

# Attention tasks and phenomena

>- Researchers devise laboratory tasks that require attentional processing

>- Measures of task performance are used to demonstrate phenomena of attention, and to test theories of attention

# Selective Attention

>- The ability to "selectively" focus or process task-relevant information 
>- and ignore or avoid processing task-irrelevant information
>- Selective attention abilities are commonly studied in congruency tasks, like the Stroop Task

# Stroop Effect

```{r}

# Explanation

>- What processes are responsible for the list-wide proportion congruent effect?

>- Strategic Account
>- Learning Account

# Strategic Account

Participants can predict congruency of upcoming trial

>- 75% congruent-> Prepare in advance of trial to attend to word dimension (because it is easy and fast)
>- 25% congruent -> Prepare in advance of trial to ignore word dimension 

# Learning Account

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

>- Some Stroop items are presented more than others
>- RTs are faster for more frequent (more practice) than less frequent items

# Testing Voluntary Control

Let’s conduct an in-class experiment on the Stroop experiment

# Question

Can people voluntarily control how they attend to word-information?

# Logic

>- If people can choose to ignore word information then the Stroop effect should get smaller

>- If people can increase their focus on word information then the Stroop effect should get larger

# Instructional Manipulation

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

**IGNORE WORD** Instructions

>- Tell people to **ignore** word information while they do a Stroop task

:::

::: {.col-md-6}

**FOCUS on WORDS** Instructions

>- Tell people to **focus** on word information while they do a Stroop task

:::
::::

# Predictions

>- What do we predict will happen?
>- What would our results look like in a graph?
