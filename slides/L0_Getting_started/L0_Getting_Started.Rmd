# Assessments and grading

There are 12 learning modules, and three exams. The grading rubric is below:

2. Include readings, quizzes/assignments, supplementary lectures
3. Complete the work within the week (submit by due date)
4. Lots of assignment choice (see next slide)

# Assignment choice

- modules have multiple possible assignments, (e.g., quiz and/or writing assignment).

- you choose which assignments to complete.

- Complete as many as you want, max 85 points toward final grade

- If you miss an assignment that is OK, you can do an extra one in a future module

# Assessments

- There are three major assessments worth 5 points each.

- Assessments are self-reflective and used to collaboratively set and achieve goals for engaging with the course material.

# Grading/Ungrading

- Except for the optional weekly quizzes, all assignments and major assessments are self-assessed. 
- Students submit their assignment and recommend their own grades/points for the assignment

- Upon submission of the final assessment, students give a recommendation for their final course grade

- The instructor makes final grading decisions

# Academic Integrity

It is your responsibility to understand [the CUNY academic integrity policy](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/) and conduct your behavior according to a high standard of academic integrity.
