### For students in my class

If you are a student in my class, then we will be using the resources on this website along with blackboard throughout the semester. This website will always contain the most up-to-date syllabus. The syllabus, textbook, and learning modules, slides, and other resources can all be accessed using the tabs at the top of the page.

Begin with the [getting started learning module](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/articles/modules/L0_Getting_Started.html).

If you have questions please email me. If you think other students have the same question, then please ask your question on the blackboard discussion board for this course.
