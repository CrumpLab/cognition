### For students in my class

We will use the resources on this website along with blackboard throughout the semester. This website will always contain the most up-to-date syllabus. The syllabus, textbook, and learning modules, slides, and other resources can all be accessed using the tabs at the top of the page.

Looking forward to meeting you in class!

If you have questions please email me. If you think other students have the same question, then please ask your question on the blackboard discussion board for this course.
