Thirty nine of these articles were produced by 78 authors who authored three or more of them, and more than half were published by only five journals. The mean number of cites per year and the total number of citations necessary for an article to achieve various percentile rankings are reported for each journal. The mean number of citations necessary for an article published within each half-decade to rank at any given percentile has steadily increased from 1950 to 2004. Of the articles that we surveyed, 11~\% had zero total citations, and 35~\% received fewer than four total citations. Citations for post-1994 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles have generally continued to grow across each of their 3-year postpublication bins. For pre-1995 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles, citations peaked in the 4- to 6- or 7- to 9-year postpublication bins and decreased linearly thereafter, until asymptoting. In contrast, for the top-500 articles, (a) for pre-1980 articles, citations grew and peaked 10–18-year postpublication bins, and after a slight decrease began to linearly increase again; (b) for post-1979 articles, citations have continually increased across years in a nearly linear fashion. We also report changes in topics covered by the top-cited articles over the decades.},

  abstract = {A little over 35~years have passed since the original Larry P. decision was handed down in 1979 by Robert Peckham, a federal judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The “Larry P. case” is a shorthand moniker that refers to a class action lawsuit, supported by the Bay Area Association of Black Psychologists, on behalf of African-American students who are overrepresented in (what were called at that time) Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) classes in the San Francisco School District. Judge Peckham ruled that standardized individually administered IQ tests used to classify African-American students into EMR programs are culturally biased and banned their use for the placement of African-American students in EMR programs in the state of California. Since this ruling, additional court rulings—as well as intervention by the California Department of Education—have resulted in the complete ban of IQ test administration to African-American students for any special education purpose in California public schools— which continues to the present. California is currently the only state in America in which school psychologists are prohibited from assessing African-American students with IQ tests. This paper reviews key events in the history of this important case and its aftermath and pays particular attention to highlighting the role of the California Association of School Psychologists (CASP) in these events. The article ends with key lessons learned that could be helpful to state school psychology organizations, specifically, and the school psychology profession, generally.},

  abstract = {Collectively, advocates for the well-being of African American children have long called for a moratorium on the use of intelligence testing for the placement of children in special education. With the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, intelligence testing is no longer required and in some states prohibited as a tool for assessing learning disabilities. As such, the purpose of this descriptive study is to give an overview of these changes and how they will affect the assessment of African American children. A national sample of African American psychology professionals was surveyed, and the majority indicated that response to intervention (RTI) methodologies alone are not sufficient for special education placement. In addition, there was uncertainty if RTI procedures will reduce African American disproportionality in special education. Results are discussed in terms of the need to increase the number of intervention articles that include African American children and recruiting more African American school psychologists.},

  abstract = {This article presents an evaluation of research strategy in the psychology of memory. To the extent that a strategy can be discerned, it appears less than optimal in several respects. It relates only weakly to subjective experience, it does not clearly differentiate between structure and strategy, and it is oriented more toward remembering which words were in a list than to the diverse functions that memory serves. This last limitation fosters assumptions about memory that are false: that encoding and retrieval are distinct modes of operation; that the effects of repetition, duration, and recency are interchangeable; and that memory is ahistorical. Theories that parsimoniously explain data from single tasks will never generalize to memory as a whole because their core assumptions are too limited. Instead, memory theory should be based on a broad variety of evidence. Using findings from several memory tasks and observations of everyday memory, I suggest some ways in which involuntary reminding plays a central role in cognition. The evolutionary purpose of memory may have been the construction and maintenance—through reminding—of a spatio-temporal model of the environment. I conclude by recommending ways in which efficiency of the field’s research strategy might be improved.},

  abstract = {Two of the best known eponymous phenomena in memory research were carried out as dissertations in the same era at the same university, each supervised by an influential researcher working within the Gestalt framework. Both examined the influence of unexpected events on memory. Bluma Zeigarnik (Psychologische Forschung, 9, 1–85, 1927) first reported that memory is better for interrupted tasks than for completed tasks, a phenomenon long known as the Zeigarnik effect. Hedwig von Restorff (Psychologische Forschung, 18, 299–342, 1933) first reported that memory is better for isolated than for non-isolated pieces of information, a phenomenon long known as the von Restorff effect. In this article, I present: (1) a biographical sketch of the researcher behind each phenomenon, (2) a description of their dissertation research, and (3) an evaluation of the current status of each phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Although Galton recognized in the 1880s that some individuals lack visual imagery, this phenomenon was mostly neglected over the following century. We recently coined the terms “aphantasia” and “hyperphantasia” to describe visual imagery vividness extremes, unlocking a sustained surge of public interest. Aphantasia is associated with subjective impairment of face recognition and autobiographical memory. Here we report the first systematic, wide-ranging neuropsychological and brain imaging study of people with aphantasia (n\,=\,24), hyperphantasia (n\,=\,25), and midrange imagery vividness (n\,=\,20). Despite equivalent performance on standard memory tests, marked group differences were measured in autobiographical memory and imagination, participants with hyperphantasia outperforming controls who outperformed participants with aphantasia. Face recognition difficulties and autistic spectrum traits were reported more commonly in aphantasia. The Revised NEO Personality Inventory highlighted reduced extraversion in the aphantasia group and increased openness in the hyperphantasia group. Resting state fMRI revealed stronger connectivity between prefrontal cortices and the visual network among hyperphantasic than aphantasic participants. In an active fMRI paradigm, there was greater anterior parietal activation among hyperphantasic and control than aphantasic participants when comparing visualization of famous faces and places with perception. These behavioral and neural signatures of visual imagery vividness extremes validate and illuminate this significant but neglected dimension of individual difference.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to scrutinize the Playground Movement through the lens of eugenics. The theoretical relationship was clear because of the dominant influence of inheritance-driven theories that stressed the role of play in developing desirable traits. Progressive Era emphasis on race betterment provided an optimal environment for the use of eugenic practices to correct flawed members of society; the emphasis on guided play satisfied this need. Playground leaders were also challenged by threats to its credibility from sequestration measures – ugly laws and discrimination. This forced them to defend play using instrumental definitions and caused them to acquiesce to segregated arrangements for the defective and diverse of society at times. Eugenic-like strategies were reflected in trying to normalize development of children through retracing the evolutionary trail of the race, altering future generations’ DNA profile, and as an attempt to repair the faults and failings of the current generation.},

  abstract = {A partir du début des années 1890, les psychologues ont essayé de clarifier au plan scientifique les caractéristiques individuelles, à savoir leur type intellectuel ; ils ont créé la psychologie individuelle. La psychologie individuelle avait pour objectif principal l’étude des différences individuelles dans les processus psychologiques. En 1896, Alfred Binet (1857-1911) et Victor Henri (1872-1940) ont examiné les tests mentaux proposés par divers auteurs (par ex., Cattell, 1890), et les ont trouvés très incomplets ; de plus, ils n’étaient pas représentatifs, parce que chaque test mental laissait de côté la mesure des processus mentaux supérieurs. Dans ce contexte Binet et Henri ont proposé de mesurer : 1. la mémoire ; 2. la nature des images mentales ; 3. l’imagination ; 4. l’attention ; 5. la faculté de compréhension ; 6. la suggestibilité ; 7. le sentiment esthétique ; 8. les sentiments moraux ; 9. la force musculaire et la force de la volonté ; et 10. l’habileté motrice et le coup d’œil. De nombreux tests ingénieux ont été utilisés par Binet et Henri ; ceux-ci ont été sélectionnés dans des domaines où les variations inter-individuelles étaient les plus marquées. Ce programme de psychologie individuelle a été la première étape qui a conduit à l’élaboration d’un test d’intelligence proposé par Binet et Simon en 1905. Cet article fournit: 1. un examen des travaux de Binet entre 1892 et 1903 dans le domaine de la psychologie individuelle ; 2. une traduction de l’article fondateur de Binet et Henri (1896) sur la psychologie individuelle afin que cette contribution importante puisse être portée à l’attention de la communauté anglophone.},

  abstract = {Notes that the fundamental fact about memory seems to be that it possesses two qualitatively different types of knowledge, specific and general, selectively used to perform tasks with respect to particular events and with respect to the generic identity of objects. The author contends that dichotomizing memory in this way seriously miscasts its essential nature, and results in mistaken assumptions about its subsidiary functions. It is proposed that the prime functions of memory are the construction of psychological experiences and their preservation. The construction of an experience of a stimulus is performed through the same set of principles both in remembering specific events from the past and in identifying or classifying present stimuli. It is further contended that memory preserves only one type of information, namely whatever a person does in constructing an experience of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the author argues that memory is unitary in structure and operation. He describes a formulation of memory, SCAPE (Selective Construction And Preservation of Experiences). This theory is a marriage of ideas including instance theory, the episodic-processing account of concept acquisition, the attribution theory of remembering, skill transfer, and transfer-appropriate processing.

The continued influence of eugenics in Western psychology, noted in this article, is traced to biologizing human differences while minimizing the role of social context as well as to dividing individuals into groups according to their supposedly innate fitness levels (such as intelligence and optimism). The impact of eugenics on the practice of psychotherapy is highlighted.},

Five groups of three men each were organized for examining recruits in four different military establishments, with the purpose of classifying recruits as mentally "inferior", "average", or "superior". The work justified itself on the practical counts of acting as aids in selection, elimination, promotion and assignment of men. The other committees also proved themselves to be of great utility in development of scales, selection of aviation cadets, identification of special abilities and reeducation.
