  abstract = {An assumption nearly all researchers in cognitive neuroscience tacitly adhere to is that of space–time separability. Historically, it forms the basis of Donders’ difference method, and to date, it underwrites all difference imaging and trial-averaging of cortical activity, including the customary techniques for analyzing fMRI and EEG/MEG data. We describe the assumption and how it licenses common methods in cognitive neuroscience; in particular, we show how it plays out in signal differencing and averaging, and how it misleads us into seeing the brain as a set of static activity sources. In fact, rather than being static, the domains of cortical activity change from moment to moment: Recent research has suggested the importance of traveling waves of activation in the cortex. Traveling waves have been described at a range of different spatial scales in the cortex; they explain a large proportion of the variance in phase measurements of EEG, MEG and ECoG, and are important for understanding cortical function. Critically, traveling waves are not space–time separable. Their prominence suggests that the correct frame of reference for analyzing cortical activity is the dynamical trajectory of the system, rather than the time and space coordinates of measurements. We illustrate what the failure of space–time separability implies for cortical activation, and what consequences this should have for cognitive neuroscience.},

  abstract = {In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed a three-component model of working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.},

The book contains comparatively few specific references to the work of other psychologists about thinking. In writing it, in fact, the author was not concerned to produce anything like a systematic treatise. The author had three principal aims in mind. First to try to put thinking into its place as a natural development from earlier established forms of bodily skilled behaviour. Secondly, on the basis of this approach, to design some more or less novel experiments of a predominantly objective type, and such that anybody with sufficient interest could carry further for himself. Thirdly, to illustrate a few of these experiments, and to embark upon some discussion of their results. The book is organized into the following sections: Thinking as a Form of Skill; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Interpolation; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Extrapolation; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Evidence in Disguise; Theoretical; Adventurous Thinking--Two Transitional Experiments; Adventurous Thinking--The Thinking of the Experimental Scientist; Adventurous Thinking--First Hand about Experimental Thinking; Adventurous Thinking--Everyday Thinking; and Adventurous Thinking--The Artist's Thinking.

Watson that was judged to be so reprehensible that it was offered as the real reason he was fired from his faculty position at Johns Hopkins University in 1920, at perhaps the peak of his academic career. Watson’s dismissal from Johns Hopkins may have been the most important event in his career, and it almost certainly altered the history of American psychology. Thus, this story has great significance. The claims of the story, however, have never been validated or invalidated. This article examines the evidence for and against the existence of such research and discusses Watson’s academic dismissal in light of that evidence.},

  abstract = {In 1932, Frederic Bartlett laid the foundation for the later schema theory. His key assumption of previous knowledge affecting the processing of new stimuli was illustrated in the famous “portrait d'homme” series. Sequenced reproductions of ambiguous stimuli showed progressive object-likeness. As Bartlett pointed out, activation of specific schemata, for instance “the face schema”, biases memory retrieval towards such schemata. In five experiments (Experiment 1, n = 53; Experiment 2, n = 177; Experiment 3, n = 36; Experiment 4, n = 6; Experiment 5, n = 2), we tested several factors potentially influencing retrieval biases—for example, by varying the general procedure of reproduction (repeated vs. serial) and by omitting versus providing visual or semantic cues for activating face schemata. Participants inspected face-like stimuli with the caption “portrait of the human” and reproduced them repeatedly under specific conditions. None of the experiments revealed a systematic tendency towards Bartlett's described case, even when the participants were explicitly instructed to draw “a face” like the previously inspected one. In one of the “serial reproduction” experiments, we even obtained contrary effects with decreasing face-likeness over the reproduction generations. A close analysis of the original findings raises questions about the replicability of Bartlett's findings, qualifying the “portrait d'homme” series more or less as an illustrative example of the main idea of reconstructive memory.},

Thirty nine of these articles were produced by 78 authors who authored three or more of them, and more than half were published by only five journals. The mean number of cites per year and the total number of citations necessary for an article to achieve various percentile rankings are reported for each journal. The mean number of citations necessary for an article published within each half-decade to rank at any given percentile has steadily increased from 1950 to 2004. Of the articles that we surveyed, 11~\% had zero total citations, and 35~\% received fewer than four total citations. Citations for post-1994 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles have generally continued to grow across each of their 3-year postpublication bins. For pre-1995 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles, citations peaked in the 4- to 6- or 7- to 9-year postpublication bins and decreased linearly thereafter, until asymptoting. In contrast, for the top-500 articles, (a) for pre-1980 articles, citations grew and peaked 10–18-year postpublication bins, and after a slight decrease began to linearly increase again; (b) for post-1979 articles, citations have continually increased across years in a nearly linear fashion. We also report changes in topics covered by the top-cited articles over the decades.},

We challenge these ideas in the context of skilled typing, where prominent theories assume that typing is controlled by a well-learned cognitive map that plans finger movements without feedback. In two experiments, we demonstrate that online physical interaction with the keyboard critically mediates typing skill. Typists performed single-word and paragraph typing tasks on a regular keyboard, a laser-projection keyboard, and two deconstructed keyboards, made by removing successive layers of a regular keyboard. Averaged over the laser and deconstructed keyboards, response times for the first keystroke increased by 37\%, the interval between keystrokes increased by 120\%, and error rate increased by 177\%, relative to those of the regular keyboard. A schema view predicts no influence of external motor feedback, because actions could be planned internally with high precision. We argue that the expert knowledge mediating action control emerges during online interaction with the physical environment.},

Using archival sources, Ian Robert Dowbiggin documents the involvement of both American and Canadian psychiatrists in the eugenics movement of the early twentieth century. He explains why professional men and women committed to helping those less fortunate than themselves arrived at such morally and intellectually dubious conclusions. Psychiatrists at the end of the nineteenth century felt professionally vulnerable, Dowbiggin explains, because they were under intense pressure from state and provincial governments and from other physicians to reform their specialty. Eugenic ideas, which dominated public health policy making, seemed the best vehicle for catching up with the progress of science. Among the prominent psychiatrist-eugenicists Dowbiggin considers are G. Alder Blumer, Charles Kirk Clarke, Thomas Salmon, Clare Hincks, and William Partlow. Tracing psychiatric support for eugenics throughout the interwar years, Dowbiggin pays special attention to the role of psychiatrists in the fierce debates about immigration policy. His examination of psychiatry's unfortunate flirtation with eugenics elucidates how professional groups come to think and act along common lines within specific historical contexts.},

  abstract = {A little over 35~years have passed since the original Larry P. decision was handed down in 1979 by Robert Peckham, a federal judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The “Larry P. case” is a shorthand moniker that refers to a class action lawsuit, supported by the Bay Area Association of Black Psychologists, on behalf of African-American students who are overrepresented in (what were called at that time) Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) classes in the San Francisco School District. Judge Peckham ruled that standardized individually administered IQ tests used to classify African-American students into EMR programs are culturally biased and banned their use for the placement of African-American students in EMR programs in the state of California. Since this ruling, additional court rulings—as well as intervention by the California Department of Education—have resulted in the complete ban of IQ test administration to African-American students for any special education purpose in California public schools— which continues to the present. California is currently the only state in America in which school psychologists are prohibited from assessing African-American students with IQ tests. This paper reviews key events in the history of this important case and its aftermath and pays particular attention to highlighting the role of the California Association of School Psychologists (CASP) in these events. The article ends with key lessons learned that could be helpful to state school psychology organizations, specifically, and the school psychology profession, generally.},

With the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, intelligence testing is no longer required and in some states prohibited as a tool for assessing learning disabilities. As such, the purpose of this descriptive study is to give an overview of these changes and how they will affect the assessment of African American children. A national sample of African American psychology professionals was surveyed, and the majority indicated that response to intervention (RTI) methodologies alone are not sufficient for special education placement. In addition, there was uncertainty if RTI procedures will reduce African American disproportionality in special education. Results are discussed in terms of the need to increase the number of intervention articles that include African American children and recruiting more African American school psychologists.},

Conditions were such that accuracy was about 96\%. Each experimental word occurred 3 times, denoted P1, P2, and P3. The number of items intervening between P1 and P2 was either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 items; the number of items intervening between P2 and P3 was always 16 items. Findings were that (1) error latencies were longer than correct response times on all 3 presentations, (2) P2 recognition times increased with the length of the P1-P2 lag, (3) P3 times were considerably shorter than those on P2, and (4) P3 times decreased with the length of the P1-P2 lag, showing a spacing effect.

  abstract = {This article presents an evaluation of research strategy in the psychology of memory. To the extent that a strategy can be discerned, it appears less than optimal in several respects. It relates only weakly to subjective experience, it does not clearly differentiate between structure and strategy, and it is oriented more toward remembering which words were in a list than to the diverse functions that memory serves. This last limitation fosters assumptions about memory that are false: that encoding and retrieval are distinct modes of operation; that the effects of repetition, duration, and recency are interchangeable; and that memory is ahistorical. Theories that parsimoniously explain data from single tasks will never generalize to memory as a whole because their core assumptions are too limited. Instead, memory theory should be based on a broad variety of evidence. Using findings from several memory tasks and observations of everyday memory, I suggest some ways in which involuntary reminding plays a central role in cognition. The evolutionary purpose of memory may have been the construction and maintenance—through reminding—of a spatio-temporal model of the environment. I conclude by recommending ways in which efficiency of the field’s research strategy might be improved.},

  abstract = {The dominant view in cognitive psychology is that memory includes several distinct and separate systems including episodic memory, semantic memory and associative learning, each with a different set of representations, explanatory principles and mechanisms. In opposition to that trend, there is a renewed effort to reconcile those distinctions in favour of a cohesive and integrative account of memory. According to instance theory, humans store individual experiences in episodic memory and general-level and semantic knowledge such as categories, word meanings and associations emerge during retrieval. In this Perspective, we review applications of instance theory from the domains of remembering, language and associative learning. We conclude that instance theory is a productive candidate for a general theory of cognition and we propose avenues for future work that extends instance theory into the domain of cognitive computing, builds hybrid instance models and builds bridges to cognitive neuroscience.},

This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.},

Reread pages were read more quickly, thereby revealing an exceptional degree of memory at the pattern-analyzing level.

Comparing the 2 sets of measurements showed that different aspects of memory were measured by the different tests, and they were not well correlated.

Reading text was good practice for further reading, did not quicken naming letters, but did increase accuracy. The results show why neither the analytical nor the whole word approach to visual pattern training in literacy is dominant; the 2 methods teach different skills whose components are only partially correlated.

Both examined the influence of unexpected events on memory. Bluma Zeigarnik (Psychologische Forschung, 9, 1–85, 1927) first reported that memory is better for interrupted tasks than for completed tasks, a phenomenon long known as the Zeigarnik effect. Hedwig von Restorff (Psychologische Forschung, 18, 299–342, 1933) first reported that memory is better for isolated than for non-isolated pieces of information, a phenomenon long known as the von Restorff effect. In this article, I present: (1) a biographical sketch of the researcher behind each phenomenon, (2) a description of their dissertation research, and (3) an evaluation of the current status of each phenomenon.},

More recent neuropsychological findings, drawn mainly from case studies, provide evidence regarding the various levels of representations and processes involved in single-word and sentence processing. Lesion data and neuroimaging findings are converging to some extent in providing localization of these components of language processing, particularly at the single-word level. Much work remains to be done in developing precise theoretical accounts of sentence processing that can accommodate the observed patterns of breakdown. Such theoretical developments may provide a means of accommodating the seemingly contradictory findings regarding the neural organization of sentence processing.},

  abstract = {Although Galton recognized in the 1880s that some individuals lack visual imagery, this phenomenon was mostly neglected over the following century. We recently coined the terms “aphantasia” and “hyperphantasia” to describe visual imagery vividness extremes, unlocking a sustained surge of public interest. Aphantasia is associated with subjective impairment of face recognition and autobiographical memory. Here we report the first systematic, wide-ranging neuropsychological and brain imaging study of people with aphantasia (n\,=\,24), hyperphantasia (n\,=\,25), and midrange imagery vividness (n\,=\,20). Despite equivalent performance on standard memory tests, marked group differences were measured in autobiographical memory and imagination, participants with hyperphantasia outperforming controls who outperformed participants with aphantasia. Face recognition difficulties and autistic spectrum traits were reported more commonly in aphantasia. The Revised NEO Personality Inventory highlighted reduced extraversion in the aphantasia group and increased openness in the hyperphantasia group. Resting state fMRI revealed stronger connectivity between prefrontal cortices and the visual network among hyperphantasic than aphantasic participants. In an active fMRI paradigm, there was greater anterior parietal activation among hyperphantasic and control than aphantasic participants when comparing visualization of famous faces and places with perception. These behavioral and neural signatures of visual imagery vividness extremes validate and illuminate this significant but neglected dimension of individual difference.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to scrutinize the Playground Movement through the lens of eugenics. The theoretical relationship was clear because of the dominant influence of inheritance-driven theories that stressed the role of play in developing desirable traits. Progressive Era emphasis on race betterment provided an optimal environment for the use of eugenic practices to correct flawed members of society; the emphasis on guided play satisfied this need. Playground leaders were also challenged by threats to its credibility from sequestration measures – ugly laws and discrimination. This forced them to defend play using instrumental definitions and caused them to acquiesce to segregated arrangements for the defective and diverse of society at times. Eugenic-like strategies were reflected in trying to normalize development of children through retracing the evolutionary trail of the race, altering future generations’ DNA profile, and as an attempt to repair the faults and failings of the current generation.},

  abstract = {A partir du début des années 1890, les psychologues ont essayé de clarifier au plan scientifique les caractéristiques individuelles, à savoir leur type intellectuel ; ils ont créé la psychologie individuelle. La psychologie individuelle avait pour objectif principal l’étude des différences individuelles dans les processus psychologiques. En 1896, Alfred Binet (1857-1911) et Victor Henri (1872-1940) ont examiné les tests mentaux proposés par divers auteurs (par ex., Cattell, 1890), et les ont trouvés très incomplets ; de plus, ils n’étaient pas représentatifs, parce que chaque test mental laissait de côté la mesure des processus mentaux supérieurs. Dans ce contexte Binet et Henri ont proposé de mesurer : 1. la mémoire ; 2. la nature des images mentales ; 3. l’imagination ; 4. l’attention ; 5. la faculté de compréhension ; 6. la suggestibilité ; 7. le sentiment esthétique ; 8. les sentiments moraux ; 9. la force musculaire et la force de la volonté ; et 10. l’habileté motrice et le coup d’œil. De nombreux tests ingénieux ont été utilisés par Binet et Henri ; ceux-ci ont été sélectionnés dans des domaines où les variations inter-individuelles étaient les plus marquées. Ce programme de psychologie individuelle a été la première étape qui a conduit à l’élaboration d’un test d’intelligence proposé par Binet et Simon en 1905. Cet article fournit: 1. un examen des travaux de Binet entre 1892 et 1903 dans le domaine de la psychologie individuelle ; 2. une traduction de l’article fondateur de Binet et Henri (1896) sur la psychologie individuelle afin que cette contribution importante puisse être portée à l’attention de la communauté anglophone.},

  abstract = {The experiment analyzed serial position curves in recall, global recognition (comparing probes to whole lists) and local recognition (comparing probes to specific items in a list). Input order, output order, and the spatial order to be memorized were deconfounded by presenting and probing items in random order in different spatial positions. Primacy and recency effects over input position were observed for all three tasks. Only primacy emerged over output position. Spatial position affected only recall and local recognition but not global recognition accuracy. Latency data provided additional information, sometimes deviating from the patterns of accuracy. The results support an attentional gradient as one source of the primacy effect. They are compatible with input and output interference or decay, but are difficult to explain by a temporal distinctiveness account. No support was found for response suppression and edge effects as mechanisms to explain recency.},

Hick published an article in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, “On the rate of gain of information.” It played a seminal role in the cognitive revolution and established one of the few widely acknowledged laws in psychology, relating choice reaction time to the number of stimulus–response alternatives (or amount of uncertainty) in a task. We review the historical context in which Hick conducted his study and describe his experiments and theoretical analyses. We discuss the article’s immediate impact on researchers, as well as challenges to and shortcomings of Hick’s law and his analysis, including effects of stimulus–response compatibility, practice, very large set sizes and sequential dependencies. Contemporary modeling developments are also described in detail. Perhaps most impressive about Hick’s law is that it continues to spawn research efforts to the present and that it is regarded as a fundamental law of interface design for human–computer interaction using technologies that did not exist at the time of Hick’s research.},

Watson's coining ofbehaviorism in 1913 is presented first, followed by a discussion ofthe uses of"radical" within psychology during these early years. When the term radical behaviorism first emerged in the early 1920s, its referent was Watson's behaviorism, most specifically his stance on consciousness. In the 1930s, B. F. Skinner described his own position with the term radical behaviorism in an unpublished manuscript, and then in 1945 first referred in print to his views as such. Today, radical behaviorism is generally applied to Skinner's views alone. The paper concludes with a briefdiscussion ofa similarity in Watson's and Skinner's positions on consciousness, which seems a possible historical and philosophical connection between their respective radical behaviorisms.},

  abstract = {Background. The authors investigated whether obstetricians make different decisions about a medical test case depending on the characteristics of background cases that preceded the test case. Methods. Five hypothetical cases were sent to 1247 obstetricians. The outcome of interest was the proportion of physicians who elect to perform a cesarean on a borderline test case, presented with 4 background cases. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) pathological background, in which the test case was preceded by abnormal cases, typically requiring cesarean; 2) physiological background, where the test case was preceded by relatively uncomplicated cases, often suggesting a less invasive treatment; and 3) control, where the test case appeared first. Results. A significantly higher proportion of respondents chose a cesarean when the test case was preceded by physiological cases (75.4\%) than when it was preceded by pathological cases (52.2\%). This tendency was observed among those actively and not actively involved in obstetrics and in physicians with different levels of training. Conclusions. A patient’s chances of undergoing cesarean section can be influenced by the immediately prior experience of the physician. This study with hypothetical vignettes found that background cases can influence physicians’ decisions. The test case was apparently perceived as more grave when it followed uncomplicated cases as compared to when it was preceded by abnormal cases. Such inconsistencies in decision making are unlikely to be fully resolved by expertise, as suggested by the lack of differences between physicians with different training levels. An understanding of such effects may contribute to more informed consideration of unappreciated influences in making decisions.},

  abstract = {Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) states often entail a phenomenological sense that retrieval is blocked, but incomplete activation is more commonly assumed as the underlying mechanism. Bilinguals have more TOTs than monolinguals, and commonly report that one language feels less accessible after immersion in another although evidence for this is minimal. Kreiner and Degani (2015) reported Russian-Hebrew bilinguals had more TOTs for Hebrew words after watching a movie in Russian, and surprisingly, native Hebrew speakers who did not know Russian also had more TOTs. Aiming to replicate this work, 72 Spanish-English bilinguals and 72 monolinguals completed a similar protocol in Experiment 1. Bilinguals and monolinguals exhibited significant and similarly sized interference effects after watching a Spanish movie. In Experiment 2, monolinguals completed five conditions: (a) Russian movie, (b) Spanish with English subtitles movie, (c) American Sign Language movie, (d) Spanish movie without audio and instructions to copy movements, and (e) a non-linguistic control (playing Tetris). All but the last two conditions elicited interference (increased TOTs and reduced correct retrievals). We suggest that even a brief pseudo-immersion experience can interfere with lexical-retrieval in the dominant language possibly via whole-language inhibition, supporting notions of blocked retrieval, albeit not at the level of individual lexical representations as previously proposed.},

However, the character of the presentations has changed over time. In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Watson's behaviorism was usually described as being too narrow because of its rejection of consciousness as an important subject matter. Nevertheless, his work on child psychology and emotional development was often discus at length. Starting around 1950, Watson became a historical figure whose specific findings and theories were no longer current. Although the Little Albert experiment continued to be mentioned, the detailed descriptions of his work found in many earlier textbooks became abbreviated or disappeared entirely. Watson's promotion of an objective science of behavior was mentioned in almost every modern textbook, although most stated that environmentalism was one of the fundamental features of classical behaviorism. Watson's promotion of objective psychology, according to many modern textbooks, benefited psychology initially, but harmed it later.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

An analysis of the current evidence suggests that the classical Ebbinghaus curve of forgetting is primarily a function of interference from materials learned previously in the laboratory. When this source of interference is removed, forgetting decreases from about 75 per cent over 24 hours to about 25 per cent. This latter figure can be reduced by a least 10 per cent by other methodological considerations, leaving 15 per cent as an estimate of the forgetting over 24 hours. This estimate will vary somewhat as a function of intratask similarity, distributed practice, and with very low meaningful material. But the overall evidence suggests that similarity with other material and situational similarity are by far the most critical factors in forgetting. Such evidence is consonant with a general interference theory, although the details of such a theory were not presented here." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

I focus on a central aspect of posthumanism: the erosion of the distinction between organism and machine, nature and art, and the biological and engineering sciences. I claim that this shift can be placed in the seventeenth century, in Descartes’s biology. The Cartesian fusion of the natural and technological opened the door to distinctly posthuman understandings of the living body, its relation to technological extensions, and the possibility of its drastic alteration. Descartes’s mechanicism demanded a reconceptualization of bodily boundaries, organismic unity, natural finality, causation, and bio/technological instrumentality; all of which Descartes boldly theorized in terms of the wondrous technologies of his day. This radical proposal obscured the possibility of thinking the human as ontologically unique, or as having an ideal unity. This paper will examine the posthuman ramifications of these aspects of Descartes’s philosophy.},

  abstract = {Notes that the fundamental fact about memory seems to be that it possesses two qualitatively different types of knowledge, specific and general, selectively used to perform tasks with respect to particular events and with respect to the generic identity of objects. The author contends that dichotomizing memory in this way seriously miscasts its essential nature, and results in mistaken assumptions about its subsidiary functions. It is proposed that the prime functions of memory are the construction of psychological experiences and their preservation. The construction of an experience of a stimulus is performed through the same set of principles both in remembering specific events from the past and in identifying or classifying present stimuli. It is further contended that memory preserves only one type of information, namely whatever a person does in constructing an experience of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the author argues that memory is unitary in structure and operation. He describes a formulation of memory, SCAPE (Selective Construction And Preservation of Experiences). This theory is a marriage of ideas including instance theory, the episodic-processing account of concept acquisition, the attribution theory of remembering, skill transfer, and transfer-appropriate processing.

The continued influence of eugenics in Western psychology, noted in this article, is traced to biologizing human differences while minimizing the role of social context as well as to dividing individuals into groups according to their supposedly innate fitness levels (such as intelligence and optimism). The impact of eugenics on the practice of psychotherapy is highlighted.},

Five groups of three men each were organized for examining recruits in four different military establishments, with the purpose of classifying recruits as mentally "inferior", "average", or "superior". The work justified itself on the practical counts of acting as aids in selection, elimination, promotion and assignment of men. The other committees also proved themselves to be of great utility in development of scales, selection of aviation cadets, identification of special abilities and reeducation.
