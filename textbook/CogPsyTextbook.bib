  abstract = {From citation rates for over 85,000 articles published between 1950 and 2004 in 56 psychology journals, we identified a total of 500 behavioral cognitive psychology articles that ranked in the top 0.6~\% in each half-decade, in terms of their mean citations per year using the Web of Science. Thirty nine of these articles were produced by 78 authors who authored three or more of them, and more than half were published by only five journals. The mean number of cites per year and the total number of citations necessary for an article to achieve various percentile rankings are reported for each journal. The mean number of citations necessary for an article published within each half-decade to rank at any given percentile has steadily increased from 1950 to 2004. Of the articles that we surveyed, 11~\% had zero total citations, and 35~\% received fewer than four total citations. Citations for post-1994 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles have generally continued to grow across each of their 3-year postpublication bins. For pre-1995 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles, citations peaked in the 4- to 6- or 7- to 9-year postpublication bins and decreased linearly thereafter, until asymptoting. In contrast, for the top-500 articles, (a) for pre-1980 articles, citations grew and peaked 10–18-year postpublication bins, and after a slight decrease began to linearly increase again; (b) for post-1979 articles, citations have continually increased across years in a nearly linear fashion. We also report changes in topics covered by the top-cited articles over the decades.},

  abstract = {This article presents an evaluation of research strategy in the psychology of memory. To the extent that a strategy can be discerned, it appears less than optimal in several respects. It relates only weakly to subjective experience, it does not clearly differentiate between structure and strategy, and it is oriented more toward remembering which words were in a list than to the diverse functions that memory serves. This last limitation fosters assumptions about memory that are false: that encoding and retrieval are distinct modes of operation; that the effects of repetition, duration, and recency are interchangeable; and that memory is ahistorical. Theories that parsimoniously explain data from single tasks will never generalize to memory as a whole because their core assumptions are too limited. Instead, memory theory should be based on a broad variety of evidence. Using findings from several memory tasks and observations of everyday memory, I suggest some ways in which involuntary reminding plays a central role in cognition. The evolutionary purpose of memory may have been the construction and maintenance—through reminding—of a spatio-temporal model of the environment. I conclude by recommending ways in which efficiency of the field’s research strategy might be improved.},

Both examined the influence of unexpected events on memory. Bluma Zeigarnik (Psychologische Forschung, 9, 1–85, 1927) first reported that memory is better for interrupted tasks than for completed tasks, a phenomenon long known as the Zeigarnik effect. Hedwig von Restorff (Psychologische Forschung, 18, 299–342, 1933) first reported that memory is better for isolated than for non-isolated pieces of information, a phenomenon long known as the von Restorff effect. In this article, I present: (1) a biographical sketch of the researcher behind each phenomenon, (2) a description of their dissertation research, and (3) an evaluation of the current status of each phenomenon.},

Criteria of performance were number of trials necessary for learning, and trials necessary for relearning after two weeks. No reliable differences between any of the four techniques was found. Learning trials and transcription score correlated .72. Learning and relearning trials correlated .78. The sequence of unilateral trials preliminary to coordinated trials is favored. The interpolated keyboard practice gave either no advantage or positive interference with learning. Bibliography of 26 titles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Notes that the fundamental fact about memory seems to be that it possesses two qualitatively different types of knowledge, specific and general, selectively used to perform tasks with respect to particular events and with respect to the generic identity of objects. The author contends that dichotomizing memory in this way seriously miscasts its essential nature, and results in mistaken assumptions about its subsidiary functions. It is proposed that the prime functions of memory are the construction of psychological experiences and their preservation. The construction of an experience of a stimulus is performed through the same set of principles both in remembering specific events from the past and in identifying or classifying present stimuli. It is further contended that memory preserves only one type of information, namely whatever a person does in constructing an experience of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the author argues that memory is unitary in structure and operation. He describes a formulation of memory, SCAPE (Selective Construction And Preservation of Experiences). This theory is a marriage of ideas including instance theory, the episodic-processing account of concept acquisition, the attribution theory of remembering, skill transfer, and transfer-appropriate processing.
