## Test the pipeline

This semester students will be submitting their work as github repositories. Follow these steps to test the github pipeline to make sure it is working:

1. Create a new R project (initialize with git)
2. Create a new R Markdown document
3. Publish the R project folder on Github.com
4. Make commits and demonstrate that your local changes are reflected on github.com
