# Attention and Working Memory

## Working Memory

In the last chapter we discussed the multi-store model and it's reliance an a loose structural metaphor of separate memory systems. There was a short-term store with slots that could be easily filled up, and a long-term store that was more like a large warehouse, capable of storing many memory traces. The model could explain some findings, like a regular recency effect, but not other findings, like the long-term recency effect. Findings like the long-term recency effect were inconvenient for the multi-store model, but useful for moving theories in memory research forward. For example, some researchers began considering alternative theories, such as how a single long-term memory system might be able to explain all of the recency effects. A single system explanation would not require the theoretical distinction between a short and long-term store. And, as single system explanations became more popular, some researchers began to abandon the distinction between short and long-term memory systems. However, other researchers took the opposite approach, and reformulated the distinction between short and long-term memory in terms of a "working memory" system. 

## The computer metaphor of working memory

Baddeley and Hitch proposed their working memory model in 1974 [@baddeleyWorkingMemory1974a]. The model describes some aspects of memory and cognition in terms of a collection of interconnected sub-systems. Over time, the model has been expanded to include more sub-systems. I will use a computer metaphor to describe the model, because the components of a modern digital computer are very similar to the proposed subsystems in working memory.

A computer is a great example of an information processor that is split up into interconnected sub-systems. Computers have different kinds of memory storage systems. For example, a computer hard-drive is like long-term memory, it is large and can store many bits of information on a permanent basis. Computers also have random-access memory (RAM) which is like short-term memory. Random-access memory is a temporary location where bits of information can be manipulated by the central processing unit. In a computer, the central processing unit is a serial system that processes one bit at a time. The speed of a computer is often limited by the speed of the CPU, which is a central bottleneck in a computer. When I was growing up, home computers only had one CPU, and they were much slower than today's computers. By contrast, many computers today have multiple CPU cores capable of spinning very quickly and processing an enormous number of bits per second.

Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model distinguishes between long and short-term memory, just like the multi-store model; but, it redefines short-term memory in terms of a mental workspace for the short-term manipulation of information. Thus, short-term memory becomes "working memory". The whole scheme is like a computer. Long-term memory is like a hard-drive where many memory traces can be stored on a long-term basis. Short-term memory is more like the rest of the computer. It's not just a temporary storage device, it is collection of sub-systems that store and manipulate information on a short-term basis. 

The original working memory system had three major sub-systems: a central executive, an articulatory loop, and a visuo-spatial sketchpad. The central executive is like the central processing unit of cognition. It is assumed to be limited in capacity, and capable of manipulating all information in the working-memory system. The articulatory loop is like the soundcard of a computer, it is a dedicated system for inner-speech that allows someone to rehearse information using verbal codes. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is like the graphics card of a computer, it is a dedicated system for temporarily processing visual and spatial information. The early focus of the model was on the division of labor between sub-systems, and the idea that different kinds of information (e.g., verbal versus visual information) were processed by specialized sub-systems. As the model developed over time, another subsystem for integrating information across the specialized systems was proposed, and termed the episodic buffer [@baddeleyEpisodicBufferNew2000]. We discuss the concept of "episodic memory" in the second half of this chapter.

major new addition is the modal subsystems...dedicated for verbal and visual codes. The other components incorporated previous ideas..like a limited capacity central channel, and short vs long term stores
