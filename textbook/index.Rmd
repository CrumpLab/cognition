<img class="cover" src="imgs/cover.jpg" width="50%"/> This is a free, open-educational textbook and set of course materials for an introductory undergraduate course in cognition. The materials are not yet complete, and I am continuing to develop them across the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters. All of the materials are [CC BY-SA 4.0 creative-commons licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and free for others to use, copy, remix, re-use.

```

The suite is developed using open-source software (R, RStudio, Bookdown). The source code for this project is available at <https://github.com/CrumpLab/cognition>. 

The suite includes:

1. This textbook: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook>
2. A course website: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/>
3. Web-based slide decks for a one semester long course (see course website)
4. An exam test bank (email mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu)

The above material is in various stages of development, and should be complete by 2022.

We have plans to continually revise, improve, and add to this suite. In particular, a major stretch goal for the textbook is to embed lab activities in the form of web-based experiment demonstrations, and data-analysis demonstrations. Another goal is to develop tutorials showing others how to copy, use, and/or collaborate on content development.
