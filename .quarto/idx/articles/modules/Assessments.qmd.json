These assessments take the place of conventional midterms and final exams, and are being developed in collaboration with the class. The instructions for each assessment are posted below. The purpose of the first assessment at the beginning of the course is for students to identify and set goals. The purpose of the second assessment in the middle of the semester is to reflect on progress so far, re-evaluate and refine, and make adjustments if necessary for the rest of the semester. The final assessment occurs during the final exam period, and provides an opportunity to reflect upon progress made toward goals in the course.\n\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to identify and set goals for the course.\n\nInstructions: This assessment has already been completed in class.
