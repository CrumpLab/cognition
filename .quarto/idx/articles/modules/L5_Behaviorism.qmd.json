QUIZ: Complete the L5: Behaviorism quiz (5 points, on blackboard)\n2. Writing: Choose from any or all of the writing assignments below (5 points, instructions below, submit on blackboard)\n\nSubmit your work before the due date posted on blackboard. Then, move on to the next learning module.\n::::\n:::\n::::\n:::::\n\n<br>\n\n\n### Rabbit Hole: listen and react\n\n5 points\n\nListen to the Rabbit hole podcast by the New York Times. You should listen to the \"Start here\" podcast (5 minute overview), and then the first act \"One: Wonderland\" (26 minutes). Feel free to listen to more.\n\n<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/podcasts/rabbit-hole-prologue.html>\n<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html>\n\nIn at least 250 words, describe connections between the behaviorist goals of predicting and controlling behavior for the purposes of social engineering, with the issues discussed in the podcast. Is the youtube algorithm a successful modern example of the ideas of behaviorism? Are there potential positive and/or negative implications for society?\n\n\n### Watson: A controversial behaviorist\n\n5 points\n\nI suggested that J.B. Watson was a controversial researcher who promoted behaviorism. If you would like to learn more about why J.B. Watson was a controversial figure, then this assignment is for you. Your task is to read Oksana Yakushko's chapter 5, \"From the Science of Human Betterment to the Science of Behavioral Control\" (available on blackboard). This chapter makes useful connections between eugenics and behaviorism, with a focus on J. B. Watson as a controversial figure.\n\n\nIn 250 words, write a reflection on what you learned from this chapter. \n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"L5_Behaviorism.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.210","editor":"source","theme":["cosmo","../../custom.scss"],"title":"L5: Behaviorism","description":"This module discusses the school of behaviorism and how it legitimized behavior as a topic of scientific inquiry.
