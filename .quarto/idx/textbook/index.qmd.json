The materials are not yet complete, and I am continuing to develop them across the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters. All of the materials are [CC BY-SA 4.0 creative-commons licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and free for others to use, copy, remix, re-use.\n\nThe suite is developed using open-source software (R, RStudio, Bookdown). The source code for this project is available at <https://github.com/CrumpLab/cognition>.\n\nThe suite includes:\n\n1.  This textbook: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook>\n2.  A course website: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/>\n3.  Web-based slide decks for a one semester long course (see course website)\n4.  An exam test bank (email mcrump\\@brooklyn.cuny.edu)\n\nThe above material is in various stages of development, and should be complete by 2022.\n\nWe have plans to continually revise, improve, and add to this suite. In particular, a major stretch goal for the textbook is to embed lab activities in the form of web-based experiment demonstrations, and data-analysis demonstrations. Another goal is to develop tutorials showing others how to copy, use, and/or collaborate on content development.\n\n## Licensing and Citation {.appendix}\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css","custom.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.210","editor":"source","theme":["cosmo","../custom.scss"],"title":"Instances of Cognition","subtitle":"Questions, Methods, Findings, Explanations, Applications, and Implications","author":"Matthew J.
