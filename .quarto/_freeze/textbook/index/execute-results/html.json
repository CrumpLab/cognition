The materials are not yet complete, and I am continuing to develop them across the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters. All of the materials are [CC BY-SA 4.0 creative-commons licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and free for others to use, copy, remix, re-use.\n\nThe suite is developed using open-source software (R, RStudio, Bookdown). The source code for this project is available at <https://github.com/CrumpLab/cognition>.\n\nThe suite includes:\n\n1.  This textbook: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook>\n2.  A course website: <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/>\n3.  Web-based slide decks for a one semester long course (see course website)\n4.  An exam test bank (email mcrump\\@brooklyn.cuny.edu)\n\nThe above material is in various stages of development, and should be complete by 2022.\n\nWe have plans to continually revise, improve, and add to this suite. In particular, a major stretch goal for the textbook is to embed lab activities in the form of web-based experiment demonstrations, and data-analysis demonstrations. Another goal is to develop tutorials showing others how to copy, use, and/or collaborate on content development.\n\n## Licensing and Citation {.appendix}\n",
