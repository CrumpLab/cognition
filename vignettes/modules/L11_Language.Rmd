## Engage {.mt-5}

When you are ready complete any or all of the following assignments.

1. QUIZ: Complete the L11: Language quiz (5 points, on blackboard)
2. Writing: (5 points, instructions below, submit on blackboard)

Submit your work before the due date posted on blackboard. Then, move on to the next learning module.

### Describe a curious language phenomena or experience 

5 points

This is a short writing assignment for you to describe any curious or interesting language phenomena that you may have experienced. This is an open-ended prompt for you to reflect on your own language experiences and then describe why it is interesting and what it might tell us about how language processes work.

Here are some example topics. Have you ever accidentally said a word you didn't mean to say? Have you temporarily forgotten a word that you know you know? Are you really good at saying words really fast? Have you had trouble learning new words? Have you ever thought you knew the meaning of a word, but later found out that the word didn't mean what you thought it meant?

Any of those examples and more would be suitable for the assignment. Discuss the example, then consider what you think the experience might mean for the cognitive processes involved in language.

Minimum 150 words.
