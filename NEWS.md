# psyc7709Lab 0.0.0.9004

- Added labs up to Linear Regression
- beginning to restructure content into a web-book <https://crumplab.github.io/rstatsforpsych/>, current plan is to keep this website for the course, but link to the book, and continue to develop new labs on the other repo, or something like that

# psyc7709Lab 0.0.0.9003

- Added a code reference page with base R example code and tidyverse (dplyr and ggplot) examples

# psyc7709Lab 0.0.0.9002

We had our first online meeting today (Thursday, Aug 27th), if you are a student reading this, Hi Everyone! I'm going to use the news part of this website to keep track of new course content, and do a bit of reflection on how things are going.

- Our online class meeting time is 1.5 hours. I'm considering adopting a consistent structure for that meeting time:
  - Review, New, Do
  - 20-30 minutes of Review (let's clarify R concepts from the previous week's lab)
  - 30-40 minutes of New (we go over the lab for this week)
  - 20-30 minutes of Do (let's work on the generalization problems)

# psyc7709Lab 0.0.0.9001

- added getting started page with info about downloading and installing all necessary software
- added some introductory screencasts about using R, R markdown, and some basic programming
- added Lab 1, and hope to have adopted a consistent lab structure
  1. A written document explaining lab content
  2. A "lecture" video of the lab
  3. A generalization assignment that students complete (usually an R Markdown document) and submit to github

- Creating the course website as a pkgdown/vertical project
