# A regular slide with text


Here is some text that I would like to say. It is a paragraph of text. 

Most of the time I would not make a slide with a paragraph. It would be too much text. So, instead of a paragraph. Point form would be better.

## This is a basement level slide

Need to click down to go to this slide

# This is the next right-ward slide

Another slide

# bold and italics

This is a **bolded** word.

This is an *italicized* word

# A regular slide with a list

2. Another thing, that is this
    - here are some additional sub points
    - and another one
3. A third thing, is this one
