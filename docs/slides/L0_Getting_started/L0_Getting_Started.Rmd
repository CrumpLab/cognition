# Assignment choice

- modules have multiple possible assignments, (e.g., quiz and writing assignment).

- you choose which assignments to complete.

- Complete as many as you want, max 60 points toward final grade

- If you miss an assignment that is OK, you can do an extra one in a future module

# Extra-credit

- If you complete more than 60 points of assignments/quizzes, then your extra points will be converted to extra credit points ta a ratio of 5 to 1.

- 100 - 60 = 40/5 = 8 extra credit points

- maximum 10 extra credit points

# Exams

- Exams will be open for a whole week

- Exams are multiple choice, around 45+ questions, test content from preceding learning modules.

- The questions are similar to the quiz questions. Quizzes are practice for the exams.
