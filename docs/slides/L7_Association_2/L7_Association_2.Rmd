## Reminders from last class

We will continue talking about associations. Additional/optional readings for today were posted on blackboard

Reminder: Quiz 2 closed last night

**Quiz 3 will be posted Wednesday, Sept 29th.** Quiz 3 will be open for 1 week, and will cover content on Associations and Behaviorism

## Course Learning Goal

An important learning goal for this course is to give you skills to help you read and interpret primary research articles in psychology.

## How to read journal articles?

QALMRI is an acronym and method for identifying and understanding major components of primary research articles

## Question

Research begins with a question, and the point of research is to answer the question

There are usually at least 2 levels: **big question** and the **specific questions**

Big questions usually take many experiments to answer, small questions are usually the focus of the present research

## Question example

**Big Question**: Does language influence perception?

**Specific Question**: If one language has a term for a specific color, and another language does not have that term, will the speakers of the two languages perceive that color differently?

## Alternatives

Experiments commonly consider at least two alternative hypotheses that about the specific question and explain why they are plausible

When reading a paper or proposing an experiment, attempt to identify the alternatives discussed by authors

## Alternatives Example

1. It is plausible that speakers of different languages could perceive colors differently based on evidence that top-down processes can influence perception

2. The alternative, that speakers of different languages will not perceive colors differently is plausible because color perception may be impervious to top-down influences, and entirely driven by bottom-up properties of the visual system

## Top-down influences

```

## Logic

The logic identifies how the experiment design will allow the experimenter to distinguish between the alternatives

IF alternative 1 (and not 2) is correct, THEN when a particular variable is manipulated, participants behavior should change in a certain way.

There should be separate logic statements for each alternative

## Logic examples

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

A1: If a person's native language influences their perception of color, then speakers who have a term for a given color should respond differently to that color than speakers whose language contains no term for that color


:::

::: {.col-md-6}

A2: If a personâ€™s native language **does not** influence their perception of color, then speakers who have a term for a given color should respond **no differently** to that color than speakers whose language contains no term for that color

:::
::::


## Methods

Identifies the procedures that will be used to implement the logical design

Should state independent variable (what is manipulated) and dependent variable (what is measured)

Describes subjects, how they were divided into groups, materials, stimuli, etc.

## Results

Identifies the outcome or findings from the experiment

Did different groups produce different means? What were they? What was the pattern of results? Were the results reliable?

Graphs, tables, statistics used to show data

## Inferences

What can the results of the experiment tells us about the alternatives?

Well designed studies may be able to eliminate one of the alternative hypotheses

## Inferences continued

Any potential problems with the experiment that could have explained the results? Any confounds?

Problems during data collection?

What is the hypothetical next step, if you were to conduct a follow-up, what would it be? 

What next specific question remains unanswered?

What new questions do your results raise?

## QALMRI Summary

**Question**: What was the broad and specific question?

**Alternatives**: What are possible answers, why are they plausible?

**Logic**: If hypothesis 1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? If hypothesis 2 was true, what was the predicted outcome?

**Methods**: What was the experimental design? 

**Result**:What was the pattern of data

**Inference**: What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data



## Questions and Next class

Next class is Wednesday, Sept 29th.

Reading is Chapter 6 on [Behaviorism](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/behaviorism.html)

Quiz 3 will be posted today, Monday, Sept 27. Quiz 3 will be open for 1 week, and will cover content on Associations and Behaviorism
