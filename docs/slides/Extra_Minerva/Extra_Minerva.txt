# Overview

1.  A poetic process theory
2.  Principles of instance theory
3.  Implementing the principles computationally
4.  Examining the model

# Mnemic Psychology

**Historical Sidenote**

-   Modern instance theory is broadly consistent with Richard Semon's theory of memory developed in Mnemic Psychology (1923)
-   Semon was a German theorist whose ideas were largely forgotten until they were translated to English (mid-century)
-   See Schacter, D. L., Eich, J. E., & Tulving, E. (1978). Richard Semon's theory of memory. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 17(6), 721-743.
-   Semon's ideas inspired Hintzman's MINERVA 2

# Instance theory primers

-   A collection of related process theories of memory and cognition
-   Different researchers have different versions (broadly similar)
-   Instance theories range in specificity from verbal theories to computational models

# Example verbal instance theories

# Big ideas from Instance theory

1.  Offers testable processing explanations for how memory works:

-   not a simple stage model
-   does not invoke special processing
-   representations are defined
-   encoding and retrieval operations are defined

2.  Shows how memory processes can do more than just remember, and may be responsible for many other cognitive abilities.

# Minerva 2

-   MINERVA 2 is a global-matching model of memory (Hintzman, 1984,86,88)

-   applied across numerous domains

    -   Frequency judgments (Hintzman, 1988)
    -   False Memory (Arndt, 1998)
    -   Selective memory deficits (Curtis & Jamieson, 2019)
    -   Age-related memory decline (DRYAD, Benjamin, 2012)
    -   Prototype abstraction (Hintzman, 1986)
    -   Artificial Grammar Learning (Jamieson & Mewhort, 2009)

# Minerva 2 continued

-   Implicit Sequence Learning (Jamieson & Mewhort, 2009b)
-   Judgments of Likelihoods (Doughert, 1999)
-   Eyewitness identification (Clark, 2003)
-   lexical access (Goldinger, 1998)
-   Associative Learning (MINERVA-AL, Jamieson et al., 2010)
-   Semantic memory (ITS, Jamieson et al, 2018)

# General Encoding Assumption

People encode the details of their experiences in memory traces

-   Instance theory assumes very high/limitless capacity for traces
-   Every experience is potentially encoded as a trace
-   lifetime of experiences potentially available from memory, although maybe not accessible.

# Individual experiences are full of features

-   What properties are in a slice of experience?

    -   Sensory details of the environment (visual, audio, haptic, smell, etc.)
    -   Sense of space, time
    -   Co-occurring thoughts and feelings
    -   Co-occurring cognitive processes
    -   Co-occurring physiological processes

-   A single memory trace could theoretically contain all of the features inherent to a single experience

# General Retrieval Assumption

-   Similarity between present and past drives memory retrieval

-   The present moment is a pattern of current experience

-   Memory contains many traces of experiences

    -   each trace is the pattern of a past experience

-   Similar experiences have similar patterns

-   The pattern of current experience causes retrieval of past experiences that have similar patterns.

# Recap

1.  People encode the details of all their individual experiences
2.  Single experience are full of co-occuring features
3.  Retrieval is similarity driven.

-   the pattern in the present moment retrieves experiences with similar patterns from the past

-   These assumptions could have interesting and testable implications for cognition.

# Theoretical strategy

The instance theory approach is to:

1.  Clarify the meaning of the assumptions
2.  Postulate algorithms about how representations (traces) and processes (retrieval by similarity) may work together
3.  Determine whether a cognitive ability or phenomenon of interest could emerge from the working assumptions of instance theory
4.  When instance theory works, it offers a candidate explanation of the cognitive phenomena in question.

# MINERVA

-   MINERVA is a computational model
-   It implements some assumptions of instance theory
-   The model stores and retrieves patterns
-   The model can be trained on patterns that people respond to in cognitive psychology experiments
-   The model can produce measurable responses
-   Model performance can be compared to human/animal performance

# Explaining MINERVA

We will use the rest of class to explain MINERVA in various ways.
