# Judgment and Decision-making questions

>- How do people judge, evaluate, and assess information in their environment?
>- How do people make choices?
>- What influences peoples judgments and decisions?

# Everyday examples

How do you go about making judgments and decision in everyday life?

# Distinctions

Judgments and decisions can be made in more or less controlled ways

:::: {.row}

**Controlled**

>- Slow, effortful

>- Employs a reasoning process

# Cognitive Biases

There are many biases that shape our judgments and decisions 

>- Check out the wikipedia [list of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

# Issues with Cognitive Biases

>- Useful to be aware of potential biases to our personal judgment and decision making processes
>- Biases are not necessarily bad or wrong
>- Biases can reflect the operation of basic cognitive processes

# Heuristics

>- Rules of thumb that give close approximations

>- Availability Heuristic
>- Representativeness Heuristic

# A tale of two papers

>- Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1972). Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness. Cognitive Psychology, 3(3), 430–454. https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3

# Judgments of frequency and probability

>- How many words do you know?
>- What are the chances you will receive more than two calls from a telemarketer today?

>- How do people make judgments of frequency and probability?

# Kahneman and Tversky (1972)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/KT1972.png")
```

# Big Question and Idea

>- **Question:** How do people judge frequencies and probabilities?

>- **Idea:** People use heuristics that are usually good approximations

>- **Representativeness heuristic**: People judge frequencies and probabilities of events, or sample, based on:
   >- similarity to parent population
   >- whether the event has salient stereotypical features
   
# Logical implications

>- If people use the representativeness heuristic, then decisions about frequency and probability should be biased by representative examples

# Empirical Demonstrations

>- Kahneman and Tversky (1972) presented several examples where simple judgments about frequency and probability were biased by representativeness

# Similarity of Sample to Population

# Looking more random

# Tversky & Kahneman (1973)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/TK1973.png")
```

# Big Question and Idea

>- **Question:** How do people judge frequencies and probabilities?

>- **Idea:** People use heuristics that are usually good approximations

>- **Availability heuristic**: People judge frequencies and probabilities of events, or sample, based on:
   >- how easy particular examples can be brought to mind
   >- more available instances are thought to be more likely
   
# Logical implications

>- If people use the availability heuristic, then decisions about frequency and probability should be biased by availability
>- people should also be sensitive to self-assessments of availability

# Empirical Demonstrations

>- Tversky and Kahneman (1973) presented several examples where people were sensitive to availability, and where availability biased judgments of frequency and probability

# Assessments of Availability 1

**Question**: Are people sensitive to their own ability to generate examples?

**Method**: Show participants 9 letters (TAPCERHOB or XUZONLCJM)

>- **Estimate condition:** How many words can you make in 2 minutes
>- **Construct condition:** Make as words as you can in 2 minutes

**Result**: Very high positive correlation between estimate and actual number of words generated

# Assessments of Availability 2

**Question**: Are people sensitive to their own ability to generate examples?

**Method**: Generate items from categories (flowers, Russian novelists)

>- **Estimate condition:** How many examples can you generate in 2 minutes
>- **Construct condition:** Generate as many examples as you can in 2 minutes

**Result**: Very high positive correlation between estimate and actual number of examples generated

# Inference so far

>- People appear to be sensitive to example availability

>- People can quickly estimate whether they can produce many or few examples

>- Estimates of availability correlated well with how many examples people actually produced

# Judgment of Word Frequency

# Fame, Frequency and Recall

```{r}

```

# Results

```

# General Takeaway

>- Cognitive processes such as learning and memory can influence judgment and decision-making
>- Basic memory processes make some examples easier to bring to mind, and people can be biased by the examples they are thinking about


# Cognitive Biases
