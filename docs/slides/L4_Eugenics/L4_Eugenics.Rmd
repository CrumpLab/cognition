## "Improving" society

History is full of problematic efforts to "improve" society

- Problems include inequality and injustices

- Not all groups benefit equally from the improvements

- Oppressed groups have been targets of human rights violations in the name of improvement

## Scientific Pollyannaism

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Psychology considers itself a progressive science, but also has a long history of promoting problematic ways to improve society

## What is/was eugenics?

1. Began as an idea to "improve" society over generational time by breeding humans like other animals
2. Developed into an ideology of socio-cultural purity/supremacy and scientific racism 
3. A highly organized, widespread, and well-accepted worldwide movement
4. A system of oppression that led to many human rights violations and atrocities

## Why are we talking about eugenics?

1. The methods, research questions, and motivations of many early psychologists, including those interested in cognitive abilities were tied up in the eugenics movement
2. Eugenics provides an example of how cognitive and psychological research in general can have long-term negative implications for society

## Back to Galton

In 1880, why was Galton so interested in mental imagery?

A quote from his paper:

> The larger object of my inquiry is to elicit facts that shall define the natural varieties of mental disposition in the two sexes and in different races, and afford trustworthy data as to the relative frequency with which different faculties are inherited in different degrees.

## Sir Francis Galton

- An English Victorian era statistician, polymath, sociologist, **psychologist**, anthropologist, **eugenicist**, tropical explorer, geographer, inventor, meteorologist, proto-geneticist, and psychometrician. He was knighted in 1909. (from wikipedia)
- cousin of Charles Darwin
- Proposes Eugenics in: Hereditary talent and character (1865), Hereditary Genius (1869)

## Hereditary talent and character (1865)


:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Galton suggests that people could be selectively bred to improve the "stock" of the human race

Focused on the "highest, noble" traits of "civilized" mankind, such as intellect and general intelligence

## Geneological research

Galton studied genealogies of "Englishmen of distinction" to conclude they had inherited superior traits

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/Galton_data_1.jpg")
```


## "Civilization" vs. "Barbarians"

- Galton contrasted the "great men of civilized countries" with the "barbarians" and "savages" of "uncivilized countries"

- E.g., American Indians are naturally cold, melancholic, patient and taciturn...contain the minimum of affectionate and social qualities compatible with the continuance of their race

- Invoked fears about "the extent to which moral monstrosities can be bred"

- Advocated that Eugenics become accepted as a worldwide modern religion so that a holy war could be declared against the unfit

## Galton's methodical vision

> a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had (Galton, 1883, p.17)


## Galton's Anthropometric Lab

:::: {.row}
::: {.col-md-6}

Basic Eugenics Program

**Testing**: Measure everything you can about people to identify their fitness

**Positive eugenics**: Encourage the “good” people to breed

**Negative eugenics**: find ways to stop “unfit” people from breeding, so they eliminate themselves over generational time

## A short list of consequences

- Nazi Atrocities

- Involuntary institutionalization and forced sterilization (Many US States legalized these practices)

- Anti-miscegenation laws and/or selective intermarriage to "whiten" indigenous groups

- Racial segregation policies

- Education: Standardized testing, IQ testing, gifted education programs, residential schools

- Personnel Selection: Massive IQ testing to answer questions like, who should be sent to the front to die? Who should be an officer?

- Eugenicists in positions of power (Presidents, Elected Officials, Government Funding Agencies, University Presidents, Society Presidents, Faculty members, Prominent members of society at large).

> Thus, it was American psychology, drawing on British evolutionary and eugenic developments, that became a key force in further expanding eugenic focus in both the discipline and society, including through specific emphasis on what constituted a "healthy" human being. 

> A review of the official publications of American eugenic societies reveals that 31 presidents of the American Psychological Association between 1892 (Stanley G. Hall's presidency) and 1947 (Carl Rogers's presidency) were publicly listed as leaders of various eugenic organizations. Numerous other American psychology leaders, while not listed in these eugenic leadership rosters, nevertheless produced or openly supported eugenic works. For example, S. Franz (APA president in 1920) and J. Dashiell (APA president in 1938), while not listed as eugenic leaders, published numerous positive reviews of eugenic works with titles such as "The Field of Eugenic Reform". 

> M. Washburn, APA president in 1921, one of few female APA presidents, not only published positive reviews of eugenic books but also produced studies on supposed differences in national character showing the “striking national difference” apparently found between Jewish participants' lack of empathy in contrast to their non‐Jewish counterparts (Washburn, 1923, p. 429).
