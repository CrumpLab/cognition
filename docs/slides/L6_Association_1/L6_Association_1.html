  </div>
  <p>Excerpt from Chapter 33, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</p>
  <p>From a wrong connexion of ideas. Some of our ideas have a natural correspondence and connexion one with another: it is the office and excellency of our reason to trace these, and hold them together in that union and correspondence which is founded in their peculiar beings. Besides this, there is another connexion of ideas wholly owing to chance or custom. Ideas that in them-selves are not all of kin, come to be so united in some men’s minds, that it is very hard to separate them; they always keep in company, and the one no sooner at anytime comes into the understanding, but its associate appears with it; and if they are more than two which are thus united, the whole gang, always inseparable, show themselves together.</p>
  <p>This connexion made by custom. This strong combination of ideas, not allied by nature, the mind makes in itself either voluntarily or by chance; and hence it comes in different men to be very different, according to their different inclinations, education, interests, &amp;c. Custom settles habits of thinking in the understanding, as well as of determining in the will, and of motions in the body: all which seems to be but trains of motions in the animal spirits, which, once set a going, continue in the same steps they have used to; which, by often treading, are worn into a smooth path, and the motion in it be-comes easy, and as it were natural. As far as we can comprehend thinking, thus ideas seem to be produced in our minds; or, if they are not, this may serve to explain their following one another in an habitual train, when once they are put into their track, as well as it does to explain such motions of the body. A musician used to any tune will find that, let it but once begin in his head, the ideas of the several notes of it will follow one another orderly in his understanding, without any care or attention, as regularly as his fingers move orderly over the keys of the organ to play out the tune he has begun, though his unattentive thoughts be else-where a wandering. Whether the natural cause of these ideas, as well as of that regular dancing of his fingers be the motion of his animal spirits, I will not determine, how probable soever, by this instance, it appears to be so: but this may help us a little to conceive of intellectual habits, and of the tying together of ideas.</p>

  <div id="principles-of-association" class="slide section level2">
  <h1>Principles of Association</h1>
  <p>Associationists proposed <em>principles</em> about factors that influence the formation of associations:</p>
  <p><em>The principle of contiguity</em> states that strength of association depends on the proximity of events in space and time. Events that are closer to each other are associated more strongly.</p>
  <p><em>The principle of similarity</em> states that more similar events will develop stronger associations than less similar events.</p>
  <p><em>The principle of frequency</em> is that events that co-occur more frequently will be be associated more strongly than less frequent events.</p>
  <p><em>The recency principle</em> suggests stronger associations for recent events than more remote events.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="putting-the-claims-to-the-test" class="slide section level2">
  <h1>Putting the claims to the test</h1>
  <p>Associationist claims are specific enough that they can be evaluated with evidence. As a result, it becomes possible to use the scientific method to assess claims about associations and cognition.</p>
  <p>Some basic claims include:</p>
  <ol class="incremental" style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><p>People have associations between concepts</p></li>
  <li><p>New associations can be learned</p></li>
  <li><p>Some associations are stronger than others</p></li>

  <h1>Cattell’s Experimental Psychology</h1>
  <p>James McKeen Cattell (early mental tester from last chapter) also conducted experimental psychology research</p>
  <p>General goal was to use experiments to test theories of cognitive processes, especially those related to the formation of associations</p>

  <p>Cattell, J. M. (1886). The time it takes to see and name objects. Mind, 11(41), 63–65. <a href="https://doi.org/10/b6fr5r" class="uri">https://doi.org/10/b6fr5r</a></p>
  <p>Question? - what were his questions?</p>
  <p>Methods? - what were his methods?</p>
  <p>Results? - what did he find?</p>
  <p>Let’s take a quick look at the paper</p>
  </div>
  <div id="question" class="slide section level2">
  <h1>Question</h1>
  <p><strong>Big questions…</strong></p>
  <p>How long does it take for a person to will or think something?</p>
  <p>What processes are occurring during the temporal interval?</p>
  <p><strong>Specific question..</strong></p>
  <p>How long does it take to see and name an objects like a color or letter?</p>
  </div>
  <div id="method" class="slide section level2">
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p>Cattell “hacked” a kymograph</p>
  <p>Presented stimuli on a rotating drum</p>
  <p>Visible through a slit in a screen</p>
  <p>Measured the rate participants could read stimuli as they passed through the slit</p>

  </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div id="results" class="slide section level2">
  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>Participants took 200 to 333 ms to read each letter, when slit was 1cm in diameter</p>
  <p>Letter naming speed increased when slit is wider (can preview upcoming letters)</p>
  <p>“Of the nine persons experimented on four could read the letters faster when five were in view at once, but were not helped by a sixth letter; three were not helped by a fifth and two not by a fourth letter. This shows that while one idea is in the centre, two, three or four additional ideas may be in the background of consciousness.”</p>
  <p>“Other experiments I have made show that we can recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly shorter time than a word or letter, but take longer to name it. This is because in the case of words and letters the association between the idea and name has taken place so often that the process has become automatic, whereas in the case of colours and pictures we must by a voluntary effort choose the name.”</p>

  <h1>The subjective experience of kittens</h1>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“We say that the kitten associates the sound”kitty kitty" with the experience of nice milk to drink, which does very well for a common-sense answer. It also suffices as a rebuke to those who would have the kitten ratiocinate about the matter, but it fails to tell what real mental content is present. Does the kitten feel “sound of call, memory-image of milk in a saucer in the kitchen, thought of running into the house, a feeling, finally, of ‘I will run in?’” Does he perhaps feel only the sound of the bell and an impulse to run in, similar in quality to the impulses which make a tennis player run to and fro when playing? The word association may cover a multitude of essentially different processes, and when a writer attributes anything that an animal may do to association his statement has only the negative value of eliminating reasoning on the one hand and instinct on the other…To give to the word a positive value and several definite possibilities of meaning is one aim of this investigation."</p>

  <h1>Testing ideas about animal cognition</h1>

  <p>“Surely every one must agree that no man now has a right to advance theories about what is in animals’ minds or to deny previous theories unless he supports his thesis by systematic and extended experiments. My own theories… will doubtless be opposed by many. I sincerely hope they will, provided the denial is accompanied by actual experimental work. In fact I shall be tempted again and again in the course of this book to defend some theory, dubious enough to my own mind, in the hope of thereby inducing some one to oppose me and in opposing me to make the experiments I have myself had no opportunity to make yet.”</p>

  <li><p>Delicacy and permanence of associations: How fragile are some associations, how long do associations last after they have been formed?</p></li>
  <li><p>Complexity of associations (Thorndike intended to rank intelligence of animals as a function of the complexity of associations they could acquire)</p></li>
  <li><p>Number of associations: How many associations do different animals have?</p></li>
  <li><p>Inhibition of instinct by habit: Can an animal learn to override an instinctual behavior through associative learning?</p></li>

  <h1>Pavlov’s Liquids</h1>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“Our starting point has been Descartes’ idea of the nervous reflex. This is a genuine scientific conception, since it implies necessity. It may be summed up as follows: An external or internal stimulus falls on some one or other nervous receptor and gives reise to a nervous impulse; this nervous impulse is transmitted along nerve fibres to the central nervous system, and here, on account of existing nervous connections, it gives rise to a fresh impulse which passes along outgoing nerve fibres to the active organ, where it excites a special activity of the cellular structures. Thus, a stimulus appears to be connected of necessity with a definite response, as cause with effect. It seems obvious that the whole activity of the organism should conform to definite laws.”</p>
