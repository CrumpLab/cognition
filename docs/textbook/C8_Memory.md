## Chapter Overview

This chapter provides a compressed overview of memory research in cognition. Like other topics in this book, there has been a great deal of memory research that is too large to fit into one chapter. My personal bias is that memory processes are very important for many cognitive abilities, and further discussion of phenomena and theory from the memory domain will occur in later chapters. This overview will cover a couple early memory researchers, the emergence of different research traditions in the study of memory, and discovery of important memory processing principles.

## Some questions about memory

What is it like for you to remember something from your past? How many events from your life experience can you remember? Why can you remember something from years ago, but forget a phone number or other new information from seconds ago? How do you preserve your experiences so that they can be remembered later on? Why is it sometimes hard to remember something, but later the answer pops in your head? How can you improve your memory? How can you forget things you don't want to think about? What other animals besides humans have memories? How are memories encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain? How do people use their environment to help them remember things?

I could keep this list of quesitons going, and I'm sure you could too. I find all of these questions about memory very interesting, and even though memory research hasn't solved all of the mysteries, research on memory systems has yielded some answers about these questions and more. 

Memory research has been central in cognitive psychology because it refers to a mental process intervening between a stimulus and response. Not surprisingly, memory processes were neglected by Behaviorists for the same reason, who instead reframed memory in terms of learning processes. Even though it seems sensible that learning and memory should go together, the study of associative learning and memory have developed separate traditions in the literature. Despite these differences, memory research occurred before, during, and after the period of behaviorism in American psychology. For example, psychologists in other countries were interested in memory and made numerous contributions to understanding basic aspects of memory. 

## Early Memory Research

Let's talk about early memory research in two pairs. The first pair is Hermann Ebbinghaus from Germany, and Sir Frederic Bartlett from Britain. Ebbinghaus is famous for his research on forgetting, and Bartlett is known for his book on 'Remembering'. Both of them studied tasks that required repeated remembering, and both made inferences from task performance about the nature of memory processes.

The second pair is Bluma Zeigarnik from Lithuania, and Hedwig von Restorff from Germany, two female psychologists both of whom discovered memory phenomena during the behaviorist period, and both of whose findings were subsequently named after them: the Zeigarnick effect, and the von Restorff effect.

### Ebbinghaus's Forgetting


[Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) (1850 – 1909) is credited with making the first experimental investigations of human memory. His methods pre-date and resemble many aspects of modern memory research. Working in Berlin, in 1885, he published "Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie", which was later translated to English as "[Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology](https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft)"[@ebbinghausUberGedachtnisUntersuchungen1885].

#### What did Ebbinghaus do?

Remember the chapter on Associationism and the philosophers who explained the mind by associations between ideas? Ebbinghaus was kind of experimental philosopher who used experiments to put the philosophical principles of association formation to the test. He was the first to systematically measure the rates with which newly learned information is acquired and forgotten.

#### Methods

He devised a serial learning task to measure recitation of a list of items from memory. He used artificial stimuli to populate his lists so that pre-existing familiarity with the items would not interfere with the learning process. His stimuli were nonsense syllables ^[sometimes still used today] with a CVC structure (consonant-vowel-consonant), and were made up from randomly combining letters (see table below). Ebbinghaus noted making over 2300 syllables. He was also a remarkable subject and conducted all of his experiments on himself. 

In 2015, a pair of researchers from Amsterdam attempted to replicate Ebbinghaus' procedure [@murreReplicationAnalysisEbbinghaus2015]. They followed the original procedure closely and found similar results to Ebbinghaus. So, let's look at the modern replication to get a better sense of Ebbinghaus' task and findings.

A first point to mention, is that the task is very laborious, because it involves a single person learning many long lists of nonsense syllables. If you have ever suffered to rote memorize something, the Ebbinghaus procedure is like your worst nightmare. To give you a better sense, I created a single list similar to one used in the replication. Each nonsense syllable was created by randomly choosing triplets of consonants, vowels, and consonants ^[Note, these nonsense syllables are generated by a script in the programming language R, which is also used to write this whole book. As a result, the letters that appear in the table below will change over time, as I re-run the script to make other changes to the book. I removed nonsense syllables that are legal scrabble words in Enghlish. Nevertheless, it is possible that there are other recognizable words, the appearance of which is not intended, and is a side effect of using a random process to choose the letters for each syllable]. Ebbinghaus, and one of the authors from the replication, learned to recite whole lists, just like this, one row at a time, perfectly from memory.

\end{tabular}

In the first phase, rows of 8 nonsense syllables were learned to a criterion called "one-time perfect". One-time perfect meant to recite a whole row in order by memory, just one time. To get to "one-time perfect", the syllables were practiced by reading a row out loud in order. Practice attempts were repeated as many times as necessary. After one perfect recitation, the next row was learned and so on. There was a rigorous learning schedule spread over many days so that 70 lists could be learned.

In the second phase, each row was re-learned after a delay. The delays were 20 minutes, 1 hour, 9 hours, or 1, 2, 6, or 31 days. After each delay period, lists were shown again and relearned. The number of relearning attempts needed to recite a rows perfectly was counted.

#### Original Learning

Ebbinghaus considered the feat of reciting a single row of nonsense syllables by memory an example of learning new associations. Something like associations was the connecting glue between the syllables. Before the associations were established he was unable to recite all of the syllables from memory. However, practicing was assumed to establish associative connections between syllables. And, after enough practice attempts it was totally possible to recite a row of 13 nonsense syllables one time from memory. So, some kind of new learning must have happened to enable the recitation.

The first phase of the experiment measured how many practice attempts were needed to learn a row of 13 nonsense syllables. The results from the 2015 replication [reported in their table 1] are shown in the figure. The blue line shows around 30-32 practice attempts were needed to memorize a single row in the first phase. Each dot represents the number of practice attempts for sets of rows that would be paired with particular delays to test forgetting and relearning.

#### Savings in Relearning

Ebbinghaus was most interested in what would happen in the second phase. For example, what would happen to his ability to recite a row of nonsense syllables if he waited 20 minutes, 1 hour, 9 hours, or up to 1, 2, 6, and 31 days before trying to recite the list over again? He decided to measuring savings in re-learning to find out.

If memory for a learned row was not perfect after a delay, then it would not be possible to recite a row perfectly from memory. The row would have to be relearned. The question was how many relearning attempts would be needed to reach the same criterion as before...one-time perfect. If it took 30 practice attempts in the original learning phase, would there be any savings in relearning? That is, would the number of relearning attempts be less than 30? The data from the original and re-learning phases are shown below.

The blue line always shows the number of attempts needed during original learning. The black line shows the number of attempts needed during re-learning. The y-axis shows the number of attempts, and the x-axis shows the amount of delay between original learning and re-learning.


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{C8_Memory_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1} 

What happened after a 20 minute delay? First, memory for a row was not perfect. Instead, around 16 re-learning attempts were needed to reach the once-time perfect criterion. However, even though a row could not be remembered perfectly after a 20 minute delay, the savings in re-learning showed that the original learning was "gone but not completely forgotten". The savings in relearning was computed as the difference between original learning and relearning, or $30.77-16.26 = 14.51$. In other words, 14.5 practice attempts were saved, or not necessary, in order to get back to the same level of performance. 

What happened as the delays got longer and longer, up to 31 days? There are two ways to look at this. First, the larger plot on the left shows that the relearning attempts go up from 16 to 28, as the delay increases from 20 minutes to 31 days. This shows that the ability to recite a row appears to degrade more and more over time. However, even by 31 days, there is still some small amount of savings in relearning, suggesting the ability had not degraded entirely.

Second, the smaller plot on the bottom right shows the same findings, except the x-axis expresses the delays in minutes. Here, the x-axis goes from 20 to 44640 (the number of minutes in 31 days). This way of plotting the data makes it easier to see an an exponential trend in the number of re-learning attempts. The exponential trend suggests that the rate of forgetting, or the rate this ability degrades changes over time.

Specifically, the rate of forgetting is very high after initial learning but the rate slows down over time. For example, between 0 and 20 minutes from original learning, the number of relearning attempts needed goes from 0 to 16. By two days, the number of relearning attempts goes to 24. However, the rate of forgetting is greatly reduced as the delay gets longer. Between 2 days and 31 days, the number of re-learning attempts goes from 24 to 28. Taking re-learning attempts as a measure of forgetting, there was a big increase from 0 to 24 in the first 2 days, but a much smaller increase from 24-28 over the next 29 days.

#### Exponential Forgetting

::: {.floatright50 data-latex=""}



\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs/Ebbinghaus_exp} 

:::

In other words, Ebbinghaus found an exponential forgetting curve. Early on after learning there is fast forgetting. Lots of forgetting occurs in a short period  of time. Later on, the rate of forgetting slows down, and there is less forgetting over longer periods of time. It's like going to Las Vegas and spending most of your money on the first day, and then losing your small amount of remaining money slowly over the rest of week.

#### Spacing effects

Ebbinghaus also demonstrated the effects of spacing out practice on learning and memory performance. Two ways to practice a new skill, like learning a series of nonsense syllables, are to mass or space practice attempts. Massing practice attempts mean to lump attempts together and take few breaks between attempts. Spacing refers to adding breaks between practice attempts. Ebbinghaus showed that adding spacing between practice attempts improved his memory performance.

If you search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) with terms like "massed practice", "spaced vs massed practice", and "distributed practice" you will find many papers examining how the schedule of practice attempts influences learning and memory in many different tasks. In general, the practice schedule does matter, it can change how fast you learn something and how long you retain information. For example, a meta-analysis in 1999 looked at evidence for spacing effects in 63 studies, which used a wide range of different tasks [@donovanMetaanalyticReviewDistribution1999]. Overall they found that spaced practice benefited learning compared to massed practice. So, should you always space practice to improve your learning? Well, they also found the size of the benefit depended on the task. So, before you space all of your practice, try searching google scholar to see if there is any research on the skill you are trying to learn. There may be recommendations for "best-practice" schedules to help you optimize your skill acquisition. 

### Sir Frederic Bartlett (1886 - 1969)

Bartlett pursued research into memory processes at a time when behaviorism dominated Psychological science, and the notion of mental processes involved in encoding, storing, and remembering information was frowned upon as non-scientific. He is famous for a book titled **Remembering**, pubished in 1932, that records his extensive experiments on remembering, imaging, and perceiving.

#### Bartlett's background assumptions

Bartlett took the word **remembering** very literally and played a prominent role in establishing the reconstructivist view of human memory. To understand this view it is worth considering some other kinds of memory systems.

#### Memory is a file drawer
File drawers are a physical system for storing and retrieving information. Information in the form of words on paper is placed into files that are stored in a cabinet. The papers are given tags, for example alphabetic tags, and placed in corresponding locations in the filing system. Information is retrieved by looking up the correct file and taking it out of the file drawer. On this view, the only contents that get saved in memory are what goes into the file system. Failures of memory could include, 1) not getting placed into the system, 2) getting misfiled, 3) destruction of information due to some outside source (e.g., water, fire), and so on.

#### Memory is a video camera
Video cameras record streams of visual and auditory information and store the records on film or digital mediums. Video cameras provide a veridical record of events. Memory failures could include failing to capture an event in the record, noisy input quality, noisy playback quality, or degradation of the storage material.

#### Memory is neither of these things

The above memory sytems accomplish many of the important functions of human memory. They can encode information, store it, and retreive it. These systems are also susesctible to memory failures, as are humans. However, humans display many more interesting memory failures that make these kinds of analogies unfit for understanding human memory. The file drawer and video camera systems do not allow the memory to retrieve information that was not initially encoded. This means these devices will never produce memory distortions. However, people produce memory distortions all of the time by claiming to remember events that did not occur, or exagerating events that did occur.

#### Memory is re-membering

The word re-member literally means to take pieces (members) that were previously together, and put them back together again. Bartlett imagines memory as a humpty-dumpty process, where the broken up parts of previous experiences are put back together again by memory. On this view, memories are not complete files of experience that are simply retrieved, they are process of attempting to reconstruct previous experiences. These reconstructed experiences **feel like** events from the past, but they are approximations of those events. Some modern memory theories take this stance very seriously and claim that we do not have memories at all. Instead, we have the ability to reconstruct our past experiences, and we have the feeling that these events occured in the past.

#### Schemas

Bartlett's major contribution was the notion of schemas. Schemas are simply the rules used to interpret patterns of events. For example, stories are often told with a schema in mind. The schema might be introduce characters, introduce tension, rise to climax, resolve tension, end story. Many stories follow this format. Another kind of schema is the notion of personality types or stereotypes. These are prescribed sets of attributes that a person or group of people typically exhibit.

Bartlett assumed that we interpret and organize our experiences with reference to schemas. The schema is a hypothesized mental representation that organizes our knowledge. Bartlett is well known for his experimental investigations providing evidence for the existence of schemas. 

#### Method of Serial Reproduction

Bartlett assumed that re-membering is guided by an overarching schema. He assumed it was possible for memory to become distorted during reconstruction attempts. The main hypothesis was that reconstructed events could become shifted toward the schema used to aid reconstruction. If some information was missing during reconstruction, then those features of the reconstructed memory would be substituted by the schema, thus rendering the recreated memory more similar to the schema.

Bartlett established evidence for schema-driven reconstruction using the method of serial reproduction. He applied this method to different tasks. One such task involved drawing faces. He gave people an abstract picture that was recognizable as a face, but looked like a children's drawing of a monster. Then he took the picture away, and asked his participants to draw the face from memory. Over days and months, he had the same people attempt to draw the face memory many more times. The astonishing finding was that as people re-drew the picture, it became more and more recognizable as a regular face. Bartlett interpreted this finding as evidence that people reconstruct their memories based on schemas. His participants knew they attempting to reconstruct face, but the face did not fit very well with familiar faces. Thus, as they reconstructed their drawings, over time the replaced elements of the original with elements from their schema for faces. With enough reproductions, the participants were relying mostly on their schematic knowledge to create their faces.


<!--
[Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) (1850 – 1909) is recognized as conducting some of the first experiments on human memory processes. In 1885, he published "Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie", which was later translated to English as "Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology".



Ebbinghaus recognized that people had many pre-existing associations from their experience with the world, and he saw this as a problem for experimental investigation. For example, people might have different associations between the same two objects because of their different histories of experience with the two objects. Furthermore, he was interested in how association formation worked from the beginning, when new associations were being formed. For these kinds of reasons, he decided to create artificial stimuli for experiments. These are stimuli that would be unfamiliar, and would have no pre-existing associations. The use of unfamiliar or artificial stimuli to control for experience in cognitive experiments remains common today.

#### Reciting sequences of nonsense syllables

I should also mention that Ebbinghaus conducted his memory experiments on himself ^[single-subject research is not as common as a research tradition, but see @vossLongtermAssociativeMemory2009 who conducted a lengthy experiment on himself to estimate his long-term capacity for remembering associations between pictures]. Here is what he did.

First, he made artificial stimuli that were random combinations of consonants and vowels, called CVC strings because they were composed of three letters, a consonant, a vowel, and another consonant. Here is an example of a list of 10 CVC strings, or nonsense syllables:

> BEK DUV XAQ WEM ZAL FIV PUH KAB MEL JOX

Try reading this list out loud one time. After you are doing reading the syllables once, how well do you think you could remember them all from memory? For example,close your eyes, or look away from the screen, and then attempt to recite the syllables from memory in order from first to last. Were you able to successfully recite all 10 syllables in perfect order?

Ebbinghaus followed a similar procedure, but he allowed for practice. For example, Ebbinghaus first conducted a learning phase. In the learning phase he repeatedly practiced reciting the list from memory until he could go through the whole list in perfect order. In this way, he was able to measure how many learning attempts were required to perfectly "memorize" the list.

Ebbinghaus did many experiments and learned many different lists of different lengths. He was interested in factors that would help him learn a list, factors that would cause him to forget the list, and factors that help him to relearn the lists. We'll look quickly at forgetting, and then at the concept of re-learning.

#### Forgetting Curves

Ebbinghaus measured the first forgetting curves by waiting different amounts of time before he tried to recite on of his learned lists. Perhaps not surprisingly, he found that his ability to recite a list of syllables in perfect order got worse over time. However, he was also able to show a systematic relationship between time and the disruption of his recitation from memory.
