## Chapter Overview

<!--
questions, methods, findings, explanations, applications, and implications
-->

This chapter introduces the structure of the textbook and how it will cover aspects of cognition across the remaining chapters. The title of the textbook is "Instances of Cognition: Questions, Methods, Findings, Explanations, Applications, and Implications", which summarizes key elements of the approach. The rest of this chapter elaborates on each in turn.

## Instances of Cognition

What is cognition and how does it work? These are questions I have been wondering about ever since I started doing research into human cognition, when I started as an undergraduate working in cognitive psychology labs in the early 2000s. At that time I discovered that there was a large scientific literature on human and animal cognition that went back over a hundred years. Today, that very same literature has continued to grow and grow. Perhaps I shouldn't admit this, but even though I've dedicated over 20 years of my life to studying and contributing to this literature, I think I can safely say that I have way more questions about cognition than answers. The more I learn about research into cognition, the less I feel I know about how cognition works. It's quite possible that I am more confused about cognitive psychology now (after 20 years as a researcher), than I was before I started!

In my opinion, even though cognitive psychology is a longstanding scientific discipline that has been formally asking and answering questions about how the mind works for well over a hundred years; and, even though substantial progress has been made, there is nevertheless no emerging consensus view among researchers and labs about how cognition works. Instead, there are many labs and researchers and it is not uncommon for everyone to be researching their own unique phenomena, or forwarding their own preferred explanations and theories for the parts of cognition they are studying. I will develop the view across this textbook, that this kind of diversity is OK for cognitive research; and, that a fully grown and well developed science of cognition will continue to have a great diversity of theories and perspectives about how cognition works.

I titled the book, and this first section "Instances of Cognition" to alert you to the diversity of ideas, approaches, and interests in cognition. ^[We will also learn later that there are "instance theories of cognition", so the title is also a reference to those ideas.] I'll use the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a metaphor for the diversity of issues in cognition. The MET is very large and has many rooms containing artifacts from more and less connected cultures across the world. There are many stories behind the artifacts, and there are too many rooms to visit in one day. A tour guide can help you navigate through the museum, tell a story, and give some highlights. Ultimately, the museum and the course of human history contain many elements, and a comprehensive understanding of even single artifacts can require years or lifetimes of careful investigation.

Cognition is like the museum. It contains many artifacts in the form of questions, methods, findings, theories, applications, and implications for society. This textbook is like a museum tour guide. It is intended to highlight different domains in cognition, and hopefully find ways to tell compelling stories along the way. Like the MET is open to the public, much of the research we will discuss is open to you, in the form of published journal articles and books.

<!-- Although a common goal for many sciences is to arrive at a single unified theory that explains everything, even if this doesn't happen for cognition, I think that is OK too, because many of the possible explanations that will be generated along the way will make useful contributions to understanding cognition, even if parts of their explanations are not completely true.
-->

## Questions of cognition

Let's tackle two different sorts of questions. First, what is cognition? Second, what kinds of questions about cognition are researchers asking and seeking answers to?

### Defining Cognition

An everyday definition of cognition involves anything to do with how your mind works. We will explore cognition from this everyday perspective, and from the angles of the cognitive sciences that produce knowledge about how cognition works.

In the first textbook to coin the phrase "Cognitive Psychology" [@neisserCognitivePsychology1967], [Ulric Neisser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulric_Neisser) defined cognition as:

> "...all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used".

Neisser's definition still captures many aspects of modern cognitive research. At the same time, Neisser was also known for critiquing research interests in cognition. Here is another Neisser quote:

> "If X is an interesting or socially important aspect of memory, then psychologists have hardly ever studied X". [@RememberingFatherCognitive2012]

Neisser's criticism also remains current. Among the rooms of the cognitive museum, we will encounter examples of research that Neisser might have criticized for being uninteresting or not socially important. And, even though a great deal of research has been conducted, many interesting and socially relevant aspects of cognition remain under investigated.

It would be tempting to define cognition as a discipline in terms of the questions, methods, and findings that researchers in the field have produced over the years. This would define cognition in terms of what the discipline has historically done. However, to Neisser's point, a historical definition would be too limiting because there are many interesting questions, new methods, perspectives and discoveries waiting to shape the future discipline and definition of cognition.

### Research questions

I think of cognition as a big list of questions about how cognitive abilities work. For example, How do you remember what you ate for breakfast? How do you remember something that happened when you were a kid? How do you learn a language? How do you know how to say a sentence? How do you think your next thought? How do you imagine things? How do you learn new skills, like walking, riding a bike, playing a musical instrument, playing a sport, or a game? How do you learn new information, and how can you study more efficiently? How do you recognize peoples faces? How do you know a tree is a tree and not some other object? How do you make plans for the future? Do you have an inner voice and if so how do you use it? How do you make decisions in your daily life? What makes you prefer some music and not others? How do you control all of your body movements, from moving your fingers to subtle facial expressions? How do you pay attention to some things while ignoring others? How did you forget that phone number so fast? How did you forget what you were doing while you were in the middle of doing something? How do you learn to read? How do you know the meaning of words? How can you train your brain to get better at something? Why do you think you know a word that is just on the tip of your tongue, but yet you can't say the word, until later it pops in your head? How many memories can a person have? What does it mean to be smart? Can anyone learn anything to a high degree of skill? How do all of these cognitive abilities develop over the lifespan? How do people understand their own cognition? How do people understand other people's cognition? What about non-human animals, what kind of cognitive abilities do they have? Does my cat dream about me?

I could have kept going with those questions, and you probably could too. From my perspective, these kinds of questions are ones that cognition researchers are interested in asking and answering. Most of the above questions are "how" questions, and "how" questions are all about explaining how things work. So, one of the goals of asking research questions about cognitive abilities is to generate explanations about how the abilities work. The process of generating working explanations involves a research cycle that uses methods to generate new findings and test potential explanations.

## Methods

This textbook will mostly survey research about cognition derived from experimental or quasi-experimental methods. We will encounter numerous methods throughout the textbook that have all been specifically crafted to answer detailed research questions about cognition. In this overview section I will discuss research methods in general, in the form of the research cycle, and some examples of measurement techniques commonly employed in cognitive research.

### Research Cycle

The research cycle involves a wide variety of methods--such as the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)-- that researchers use to generate knowledge about cognition.

::: {.floatright50 data-latex=""}

<img src="imgs/The_Scientific_Method.png" width="100%" />

:::

A researcher today might begin with an **observation**--like, I find some tastes delicious and others repulsive-- or, a **question**-- how can I read a book faster?. Given that cognition has already been studied for well over a hundred years, a next step could be to understand the previous literature, if it exists, on the topic or question. For example, a good place to start would be searching [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for primary research articles that have asked similar questions.

**Prior research** can often help you understand the current state of knowledge about a question. For example, if you want to read a book faster, you should read the review article, "So Much to Read, So Little Time, How Do We Read, and Can Speed Reading Help?
[@raynerMuchReadLittle2016]. This article covers many important previous results in the reading literature that someone should be aware of before they conduct their own research. Unfortunately, it turns out that there is no known simple and easy method to dramatically improve reading speed without also sacrificing comprehension.

Nevertheless, let's imagine a researcher has familiarized themselves with the previous literature, and then they come up with a new **hypothesis**. For example, maybe reading speed could be improved if fonts for text were redesigned to make visual processing faster. Perhaps similar formatting changes could be made for braille or other reading methods that would influence reading speed. Ideally, hypotheses should have testable implications that can be measured.

Next, the hypothesis is put to a **test with an experiment**. The purpose of the experiment is to create a controlled situation where aspects of the hypothesis are manipulated to determine whether they influence the measurements. For example, a researcher might create two kinds of fonts, **some fonts could be presented in bold**, and *other fonts could be presented in italics*. Then, people could volunteer to read words presented in both fonts, and the researcher could measure reading speed.

The experiment generates measurements in the form of data that is collected under different experimental conditions. A next stage in the cycle is to **analyze the data**, and determine whether the manipulations had any influences. For example, if font type reliably influences reading speed, then the data should show that reading speeds are reliably slow for some fonts, and reliably faster for others.

The research cycle ideally involves a community of peers, so the final stage of a research project could be to **report conclusions**, or otherwise communicate the results of your research. This is typically done by writing up a research report and submitting it for peer-review to a journal. The peer-review process can help identify areas of improvement that the researcher may address in a revision. If the journal accepts the paper, then it becomes a part of the literature on that subject.

Fact and theory generation are a part of the research cycle. Fact and theory generation is the process of figuring out what facts about cognition are real and in need of explanation, and then coming up with theories that explain the facts. The research cycle can be used to test factual claims and theoretical claims, which can lead researchers to discover new facts and create new theories (i.e., a cyclical process). Last, cognition research is a human activity that is embedded within a socio-historical context. The discoveries of cognitive research can have applications in society (for better and worse), and the potential prospects of these applications can in turn influence the research process by guiding researchers to spend their time on some problems as opposed to others.

<!--
The very broad domain of all-of-cognition is very large, and probably too difficult to ever study all at once. So, a common strategy in cognitive research is to focus inquiry onto smaller pieces of the puzzle. We will see this approach in action in this textbook, because each chapter is about different domains or parts of cognition (e.g., memory, learning, attention, etc).

-->

<!--The rest of this chapter is set in the research domain of mental imagery. Despite the difficulties about obtaining truly objective facts about subjective experiences like mental imagery, the research cycle has been turning on this problem for well over a hundred years. There is way too much research to cover all of it in one short chapter. Instead, I will choose some research highlights to focus on three issues: getting facts about mental imagery, testing theories about mental imagery, and societal implications of the research.

-->

### Experiments and measurements

Cognitive research often involves formal experiments and controlled measurements. This textbook assumes you may be unfamiliar some aspects of experimental methods in psychology, and that is OK. We will cover important experimental details when necessary throughout the textbook.

Experiments are used to manipulate an *independent* variable (like type of font) and measure the influence (or lack of influence) on a *dependent* variable (like reading time). If the experiment is properly controlled and free from confounding variables, then experiments showing positive results suggest a causal connection between the manipulation and the measurement. There are an enormous number of experimental procedures, manipulations, and measurements that have been tailor made to answer questions about cognition.

In some research domains the objects of inquiry can be measured directly. For example, geologists can measure rock formations, biologists can inspect cells with a microscope, and neuroscientists can measure action potentials of single neurons. In cognition, the objects of inquiry are often cognitive processes that can not be measured directly. Instead, inferences about cognitive processes are made from indirect measurements.

Consider your ability to form thoughts, and more specifically your ability to generate examples from a category. For example, how many names of mammals can you write down in 5 minutes? Your ability to generate many mammal names is assumed to be driven by cognitive processes involved in language, semantics, categorization, memory, thinking, motor movements, and others; all of which are instantiated in a complex network of physical and physiological processes. As a result, the cognitive processes involved in something as simple as thinking of animal names are complex and not easy to directly measure. Instead, a behavioral measure of task performance is directly observable, and is used to make inferences about the cognitive processes producing the behavior. In this case, example behavioral measures could be the number of animals someone wrote down, how long it took to write each name down, and even patterns like the order and grouping of how the names were written down.

In general, measurements in cognition are taken while a participant is performing a task. Measurements are often behavioral aspects of task performance, but may involve measures of physiological processes like heart rate, or brain processes as well. Common behavioral measurements include accuracy and reaction times to complete actions or portions of a task. Technology like eye-trackers can measure eye-movements during task performance; or systems like the X-box [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) can be used to for body motion sensing. People are often asked to make judgments on various rating scales, and generate or produce information like words or drawings. Common physiological measurements include heart rate, skin-conductance, and pupil-dilation, which sometimes correlates with cognitive activities. Common non-invasive neuro-physiological techniques include [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography), [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), [MEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography), and [PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography), for measuring correlated brain activity during task performance.

Finally, measures of cognition are not set in stone, and researchers may find creative ways to gain traction on cognitive phenomena. One of my favorite examples of a clever measurement is from Patrick Rabbitt, who was investigating the skill of typewriting on mechanical typewriters [@rabbittDetectionErrorsSkilled1978]. He wondered whether typists might hit keys more softly when they make errors, perhaps because they knew they were making an error, and were trying to stop the keystroke. The clever bit was how to measure response force without creating a special typewriter capable of measuring forces for individual key-presses. Rabbitt had typists type on layers of carbon paper using a mechanical typewriter. With this apparatus harder keystrokes would impress on deeper layers of the carbon paper, while softer keystrokes would only impress faintly on shallower layers. Rabbitt did find evidence that typists pressed keys more softly when they were making some errors. This is an example of a finding or phenomena which we discuss next.

## Findings, effects, and Phenomena

The research cycle in cognition has produced numerous findings, effects, and phenomena. A **finding** refers very generally to results from the research cycle. For example, Rabbitt found that typists press keys a little bit more softly for some of the errors that they committed. Another general word for *finding* is observation, and we could say that Rabbitt observed soft responses during error production in his study. I'll reserve the word **effect** for findings that are the result of an experimental manipulation, especially where the manipulation has an effect on the measurement. Finally, phenomena refers to classes of related findings or effects.

::: {.floatright50 data-latex=""}

<img src="imgs/Stroop_stim.png" width="100%" />

:::

The Stroop effect [@Stroop1935] provides a useful example. In a Stroop task, subjects are shown stimuli like in the example to the right, and asked to name the ink-color of the stimulus on each trial. For congruent stimuli, the ink-color matches the name of the word, like the color blue in the word BLUE. The correct answer for this stimulus is *blue*. For incongruent stimuli, the ink-color does not match the name of the word, like color red in the word GREEN. The correct answer for this stimulus is *red*. The typical finding in this procedure is that participants are faster and more accurate to identify congruent than incongruent stimuli. This difference is termed the Stroop effect ^[named after J. R. Stroop who first discovered them], which refers to the effect of the congruency manipulation on the reaction time or accuracy measure. Stroop effects can be obtained with many different combinations of stimuli that involve manipulations of matching and mismatching target and distractor dimensions, and they have the subject of many investigations for various reasons ^[see the chapter on Attention], and collectively are referred to as Stroop phenomena ^[and several other terms, including congruency phenomena, compatibility phenomena, interference phenomena, and cognitive control phenomena].

There are too many findings in cognition to discuss in a single book. This textbook will aim mostly for breadth to give readers a high level overview of many findings and phenomena. On occasion we will also inspect particular findings and phenomena with additional depth to examine how experiments are used to evaluate process-based explanations of findings and phenomena.

## Explanations, Theories, and Models

Just like we will encounter numerous findings and phenomena across many domains in cognition, we will visit almost as many theories, models and general approaches to explaining those phenomena. There is no single agreed upon format for theories or models, so explanations take a variety of formats, from informal verbal theories to formal mathematical models. Explanations can also be aimed at different levels of analysis, and they are often metaphorical in nature.

One of the problems with explaining how cognition works is that cognitive systems-- like people and animals-- are extremely complex and made up of many interacting physical parts. The complexity makes a reductionist account of cognition very challenging because there are so many parts and pieces of parts to explain. For example, a reductionist theory might attempt to explain a cognitive phenomena like human memory in terms of the operation of physiological substrates in the brain, which would require an explanation of how neuronal processes work at an electrical and biological level, which would require explanations in terms of physics and chemistry and so on. Physiological accounts of cognitive phenomena are one standard for reductive explanation, but there are others as well.

### Levels of Analysis

Another approach to explanation in cognition invokes the concept of multiple levels of analysis [@marrVisionComputationalApproach1982,@mcclamrockMarrThreeLevels1991,@peeblesThirtyYearsMarr2015,@pylyshynComputationCognitionFoundation1984]. For example, vision scientist David Marr described three levels of analysis for the task of explaining visual perception from a computational perspective.

Consider first that vision involves a series of transformations beginning at the moment where light hits the retina. From here, photo-receptors in your eyes convert light into electrical impulses sent through the optic nerve, past the optic chiasm, where they are received by neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, which is further connected to primary visual areas at the back of the brain. Somehow the visual processing pathways of the brain turn patterns of light falling on the retina into perceptions. Marr considered this system from a computational perspective involving three levels of analysis ^[As a quick sidenote, the computational view of cognition will receive much more elaboration across the textbook].

Marr's likened visual processing to information processing in a computer system, and suggested that both should be understood in terms of three levels of analysis: computational, representational or algorithmic, implementational or hardware.

#### Computational Level

The computational level refers to the overall goal of a process. For example, what is the computational purpose of an eyeball? At this level, and in the context of the rest of the visual system, the goal of eyeballs could be to transduce light photons into electrical signals for further processing. At the computational level it is possible for the goal to be realizable in multiple ways. For example, smart phones with digital cameras also have a lens system to convert photons into electrical signals. So, if you were to imagine yourself as an alien researcher wondering about eyeballs or digital camera lens, one level of explanation involves understanding the purpose or goal of the system, which in this case would be to capture and convert light for further processing.

#### Representational or Algorithmic Level

The representational or algorithmic level refers to the steps taken to achieve the computational goal. A The cooking metaphor developed later in the chapter is useful here. For example, you might have the goal (computational level) of making chocolate chip cookies. The ingredients and steps in the recipe you use to make chocolate chip cookies is a good example of the representational or algorithmic level of analysis. The representations refer to the inputs and outputs of the process, such as the raw ingredient inputs, and the cookie outputs. The algorithm refers to the step-by-step instructions for transforming the inputs to the output. A good recipe for making chocolate chips contains a reasonably precise high-level description of the ingredient list (representations), and the combination and cooking instructions (algorithm) to create tasty cookies.

To return to the domain of vision, photons are the representational inputs of eyeballs and digital cameras. The algorithm in either system refers to the steps, or way in which, the inputs are transformed into the electrical signals as outputs.

#### Hardware implementation

The hardware implementation level refers to how the representations and algorithm used to accomplish a computational goal are instantiated in a physical system. For example, what specific physical elements and processes enable an eyeball to transduce light into electrical signals? Similarly, what specific physical elements and processes enable a digital camera to capture images and store them in computer memory?


#### Summary

Using Marr's levels as a guide, this textbook will mostly focus on computational and algorithmic levels, rather than on the hardware implementation level. If you are a student at Brooklyn College taking this introductory course in cognitive psychology, you will find more elaboration on brain mechanisms supporting cognition in other courses such as Mind, Brain and Behavior.

### Metaphorical Models

Metaphorical models are also common strategies for explanation in cognition. Metaphorical models refer to the process of mapping a simple model system as a metaphor for describing and understanding another more complicated system. For example, horse-racing has been used as a model for explaining the Stroop effect. The basic idea is that word and color (or target and distractor) information compete for identification, just like horses running down a track compete to get across a finish line. The metaphor does not assume that people have horses or a race-track in their brains. Instead, the metaphor provides terms and functional relationships that can provide well-fitting descriptions of Stroop phenomena, and even make predictions about what might happen to the effect under different experimental manipulations. Metaphorical models can be informal and verbal, like how I have just loosely described stimulus identification in terms of a horse-race; and, they can be more formal and mathematical. We devote a whole chapter to computational theories to provide some more detailed examples of formal theorizing in cognition.

## Applications

To simplify some of the preceding discussion up to this point, the research cycle in cognition produces theory and phenomena, and both theory and phenomena can lead to applications. For example, theory about how people learn skills could be used to modify training curriculum and enhance the skill-learning process. Even seemingly strange laboratory phenomena like the Stroop effect can have inventive applications. For example, Stroop effects have been used to detect whether or not a person may be a spy. For example, during world war II, a German spy may claim not to speak German, but a Stroop test involving German words could reveal large interference effects, indicating they do speak the language.

Throughout the textbook I will aim to point out similar applications that have already sprouted from various domains in cognition. And, time permitting, I am planning to include a chapter on cognitive technologies to highlight applications from the past and present, as well as expected future directions. Daily life is increasingly mediated by interactions with smart technologies, and applications from cognition to technology are occurring at a rapid pace. For example, when I was an undergraduate in the early 2000s we didn't have smart phones, and the problem of recognizing faces in photographs was not an easy problem for computers at-the-time to solve. However, today most phones have face-recognition built-in, and deep-neural networks can make convincing fake videos of real people--and, the cognitive sciences have facilitated both of those technological developments and more.

## Implications

Cognitive research has been developing and ongoing for well over a century. In that time, many theories, findings, and applications have been produced. At the same time, research into cognitive abilities has not always had uniformly positive implications for society, and there are examples where research applications were severely destructive for some groups of people. I think issues of equality and justice are important when discussing cognitive research and its applications, so I will also touch on these topics. One way I will do this is by occasionally discussing historical context around the research and researchers that we discuss. To take one example, we will examine how research on mental imagery ability and the early development of intelligence testing were influenced by the widespread eugenics movement of the time. This era of psychology made a deep impression on subsequent cognitive research, and raises important questions about how psychological can and should be applied in society.

### Questions to keep in mind as you learn about cognition

What are the goals of the cognitive sciences and research in cognitive psychology? Who has been involved in setting those goals? Are the goals useful? What kind of questions about cognition have already been asked by researchers? What were the scientific as well as social-historical reasons for why those researchers asked those questions? What answers were found, and how were they informative or not informative about how cognition works? How do the measurements and tools that researchers use to ask questions influence the kind of picture they build about how cognition works? What kinds of questions about cognition are not being asked that should be asked? Why are they not being asked? What benefits to society have been produced by the cognitive sciences? Have the benefits been spread equitably across different groups of people? What costs to society have been produced by the cognitive sciences? How are the costs shared by society? Are there injustices resulting from cognitive science research? Have they been adequately addressed? How should society decide whether or not to proceed with different kinds of research?

### The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth vs knowledge creation

The cognitive sciences are interested in understanding how cognition works, and this could mean that the whole enterprise is trying to figure out what is true about cognition and what is false. Science is a slow moving incremental process, so over the history of the cognitive sciences there have been many false starts. Some findings have been published that are hard to replicate (so they might not be real), and there are many theories about cognitive phenomena that have been proven to be false. There are also many findings that seem pretty stable, and there are good reasons to treat them as facts; and, despite the limitations of cognitive theories, there are nevertheless some very powerful ones out there that do a commendable job at explaining aspects of cognition.

So, as a final thought before we get started, I'm going to give you a heads up about how this textbook will generally tell you about the story of cognition. One option is for me to sort through all of the published research on cognition (there are hundreds of thousands of published scientific manuscripts), pick all of the ones that are true, and then tell you only about the true things about cognition that we know to be true. Actually, I don't think this is really an option at all. So, I'm not even going to attempt anything like that.

Instead, this textbook will tell a story about cognition that is not so obsessed with the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I don't deny that there are so-called "truth's" about how cognition works. Most researchers, including me, accept facts like people and animals are physical beings, and that cognition somehow emerges from biological processes. From this perspective, there must be some truths about human and animal cognition because cognition must be determined by physical properties of our physiology. Instead of telling a story about all the true things we think we know about cognition, I'm going to back up a little up and focus the story on the process by which cognitive science creates knowledge about cognition. Sometimes cognitive science produces knowledge about cognition that is not true about people or animals, but nevertheless very useful say for creating computer intelligence or other smart technology. Similarly, it will be important to recognize that much of what cognitive science has produced over its history resembles "working draft concepts" in the large scheme of things, and very rarely fundamental truths about cognition that everyone agrees on.

### Cognitive abilities

What is a cognitive ability, and what makes an ability a cognitive one as opposed to a regular ability? In the first textbook to coin the phrase "Cognitive Psychology" [@neisserCognitivePsychology1967], Neisser defined cognition as "all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used". This is a pretty all-encompassing definition that still captures much of what cognitive scientists continue to study today. We could use Neisser's definition to give some definition to the concept of a cognitive ability.

At the same time, I don't want to focus too much on narrowly defining cognition and what counts as cognitive abilities. We will get a better sense of what the field has studied under these terms across the chapters in the textbook. We will also see that cognitive psychologists sometimes get too hung up on making distinctions [@newellYouCanPlay1973] that can distract from the larger issues. For example, we could spend our time making a list features for what makes an ability a cognitive ability. These could include features like: involves mental effort, involves your brain, involves thinking, and so on. There will be inevitable disagreements about what features should or should not be included on the list. And, we could end up looking at lists of abilities and spend way too much time deciding how they should be categorized, rather than spending time trying to figure out how the abilities work.

### Answering How questions

It is much easier to answer a "can" question about cognition, than a "how" question. For example, can people remember information like a phone number? If you have ever remembered a phone number, then you know the answer is yes. Can you forget a phone number? Yes. We don't need the science of cognition to answer many "can"-type questions about cognitive abilities.

"How" questions are much harder to answer. If I asked you, "how is it that you can remember a phone number?"; or, even more incredibly, "how can you remember a whole personal experience that happened to you ten years ago?", what kind of answer would be required to explain how those abilities work? What kind of answer would be satisfying to you? In my opinion, there are two big reasons why how-questions about cognition are hard to answer. First, the cognitive ability in question (remembering, learning, attending, talking etc.) is usually extremely complex involving the interaction of many parts, so it is daunting to imagine how detailed and complicated the explanation would have to be. Second, depending on who you talk to in the cognitive sciences, you will find that there are different levels and kinds of explanation; so, in addition to doing the hard work of explaining something about cognition, you will also have to do the hard work of understanding how different levels of explanations work, and make choices about the kinds of explanations that are appropriate and satisfying for the problem at hand.

## How does research in cognition work?

The purpose of this textbook is to provide an introduction to the ways in which the cognitive sciences have attempted to answer the question "how does cognition work?". However, before we go into the details about cognition, it is worth spending time considering some of the ways this domain of science works to generate knowledge about cognition. So, in the rest of this chapter we will consider slightly different "how" questions-- "how does research into cognition work? And, what kinds of things does it produce that are capable of telling us something about how cognition works?". This will include some discussion of the scientific method and other methods that are used to generate knowledge about cognition, as well as a discussion of philosophy of science that should help us better appreciate the kinds of explanations available and how well the explanations work.

Some of these topics are little bit abstract, and one of the principles of cognition that will be repeated across this textbook is that learning from examples is fundamental in cognition [], and also helpful for learning abstract material []. So, we will use the example of research into mental imagery as an aid for introducing some of the major ways that cognitive research works. It is also useful to have some major landmarks in mind when navigating new territory, even it is conceptual territory. So, I will organize the rest of the chapter into three big landmarks in the research landscape of cognition.

1.  The research cycle
2.  Fact and theory generation
3.  Society and historical context

## The cooking of science: A recipe metaphor

This last section provides a cooking or recipe metaphor for the research cycle in cognition. The recipe metaphor is intended to orient you toward major features of theories, explanations, and how they are tested across the research cycle [^c1_what_is_cognition-1]. A recipe is a set of instructions for how to do something like cook a dish or put together furniture from IKEA. Recipes can take different formats (e.g., written recipes in a cookbook, cartoon's in an IKEA manual, or even do-it-yourself YouTube videos). Recipes can be more or less specific. Some cookbooks break down every single step in making a dish, others give general directions (e.g., cook it until done). Recipes have the goal of communicating instructions about how to do something. And, it is possible to evaluate recipes to see whether or not they accomplish the goal. For example, if a recipe works, and I know how to follow instructions, then I should be able to follow the recipe and make the thing that the recipe produces. Sometimes a recipe turns out (it does what it says it does), and sometimes it doesn't. When a recipe doesn't work it could be that the recipe instructions had mistakes, were confusing, or were not followed properly (problems with execution). It's also possible that a recipe is totally flawed and does not do what it claims to do.

[^c1_what_is_cognition-1]: This section starts to get into larger issues in philosophy and the philosophy science, which are beyond the scope of this book. I will attempt to make connections to these domains as much as possible throughout

Everyday recipes are explanations about how something works, and the properties of recipes are very much like the properties of theories in cognition. I would say that as a cognitive scientist, I am interested in the "recipes of cognition", and I find explanations about cognitive abilities very satisfying when they have all of the properties of a really good recipe. For me, a really good recipe 1) does what it says it does, and 2) strikes a delicate balance between describing all of the necessary steps in intricate detail, and elegantly describing the most important steps, connections between steps, and general principles that provide insight into the steps. In other words, a great recipe achieves a "productive level of vagueness" [^c1_what_is_cognition-2].

[^c1_what_is_cognition-2]: I attribute this phrase to Lee Brooks, who often suggested that theories in cognition need to find a productive level of vagueness, that are specific enough to be meaningful, general enough to be interesting, and workable enough to create insights

### Oven Fries: My favorite recipe

Let's take a break from asking how a cognitive ability works, and ask how tasty, crispy, super-delicious oven-fries work. For a long time I didn't really like oven-fries, I much preferred french fries. But, my whole life changed when I found my favorite recipe of all-time, the "Oven Fries" recipe from America's Test kitchen [@illustratedNewBestRecipe2004].

America's Test Kitchen writes very compelling recipes. I had tried making fries in the oven before. They always came out terrible. They always stuck to the pan, weren't crispy or delicious. But, I knew it must be possible to make yummy fries in the oven because I had them before with friends or at restaurants. I needed to know the magic behind good oven fries, and everything I needed to know was in the America's Test Kitchen recipe.

America's test kitchen uses the same basic research cycle to improve their recipes as cognitive scientists use to study cognition. This involves experimentally manipulating parts of the recipe to see what matters in making a good dish [^c1_what_is_cognition-3]. For example, the cookbook I have has both a great recipe for oven fries, and a short research report on all of the experiments that went into figuring out the recipe. They baked potatoes at different temperatures, put the pans on different racks in the oven, boiled the potatoes first, left skin on or skin off, tested different kinds of oil, and so on. They manipulated each of these components, made different batches of fries, and then had people taste the results each time. As they tried different combinations, they kept instructions that seemed to work well, and slowly developed a recipe that produced really tasty fries that were given really high ratings by the tasters. One fantastic insight was to salt the pan before putting the potato wedges on them, which helps reduce sticking to the pan later on. Anyway, I love this recipe for two reasons. First, it works and delivers great tasting oven fries. Second, it is insightful about what the recipe is doing, and helped me appreciate principles of cooking that I have applied to other dishes.

[^c1_what_is_cognition-3]: there is also a healthy dose of using general principles about cooking food to inform the choices they make about what parts of the recipe to manipulate

### Cooking competitions and the best recipe

The last piece of the recipe metaphor I'm building here comes from the TV show Top Chef, where chef contestants compete with each other to become the Top Chef. One of the challenges is about writing a good recipe. Each of the contestants makes up a dish and writes down a recipe for how to make the dish. The big twist is that they don't get to cook the recipe. Instead, other people have to try and follow the recipe to make the dish, and the chef's are judged on how well those dishes turn out. What really matters for this challenge is that the recipe provides a clear explanation of how the dish works. Let's use a similar kind of situation as a metaphor to examine properties and qualities of explanations in cognitive research.

In the metaphor, a recipe is like a theory about how something works. A recipe contains elements, like individual steps to follow to produce an outcome. Similarly, a theory contains components, like individual assumptions and propositions that work together to produce an explanation. So, if we are comfortable with recipes and theories being very similar, how can they be evaluated for their explanatory value? Are some recipes/theories better or worse? Are some recipes/theories true or false? Answering these questions involves an iterative research cycle where recipes/theories are put to the test and refined over time. Let's examine this with an imaginary scenario.

Imagine you are a chef-scientist and chief detective, and you have been asked to solve a food mystery. You arrive at a dinner table, and your host brings in a big silver plate with a big silver dome. The cover is removed to reveal your favorite dish. You eat it, and it is the best version of this dish you have ever tasted. The host challenges you to explain how the dish was made. Your task is to make a recipe and show that you can use it to recreate the dish.

Fortunately, you do not have to start entirely from scratch. There is a well-stocked kitchen with all of the ingredients and equipment that you might need, and even many cookbooks that might contain the recipe you are looking for. You are allowed to run experiments in the kitchen to help you figure out how to make the recipe. What do you do? How do you figure out the recipe? I will offer some opinions on things that could happen in this scenario and relate them to parts of the research cycle in cognition.

First of all, you would probably use some *background knowledge* to help guide you toward a solution. For example, if you knew some of the ingredients in your dish, you would probably use those in your experiments. If you knew the name of the dish, then you might search the cookbooks for different versions of recipes for the dish, and try each of those out to see if one of them made the dish. People have unique background knowledge, and in the context of research bring different initial working assumptions to the research cycle. If you didn't know oven fries used potatoes, you might have test out different vegetables until you found the right ingredients.

The goal is to create a recipe that recreates the dish, and there are many available recipes in the cookbooks. Similarly, a goal in cognition is to explain cognitive abilities with theories, and there many available theories in the literature. One way to test the recipes is to try them out, and examine the final product to see if it is the same as the dish you are trying to recreate. Let's consider going through the motions of testing many different recipes.

### Recipe Quality

Some recipes will work pretty well, and if you try them out you might produce dishes that are close to the dish you are trying to recreate. For example, you could easily find three longer recipes for oven fries that all work well. Similarly, in cognition it is possible to find multiple working theories of a cognitive ability that all do an OK job of explanation.

Some recipes might be extremely vague. For example, Oven Fries: Get some potatoes, and bake them on a pan in the oven until they are perfect. This is a like a "theory" that is really just a couple basic claims, and not much else.

Some recipes will be broken or nonsense. Here is a nonsense recipe for oven fries: peel bananas, put them in a blender, pour them over coffee, stick the coffee in the microwave, and then eat a raw potato. This has the appearance of a recipe because it lists ingredients and steps, but upon closer inspection, it should be clear that following the steps will not lead to the creation of oven fries. In the domain of cooking, broken recipes fail to produce the dish they claim to make. In cognition, theories can fail to produce explanations they claim to make. Just like a nonsense recipe, a theory might not contain enough coherent assumptions and steps to produce a desired explanation.

I described good, bad, and ugly recipes that range in quality for producing a dish. If we are still trying to recreate create the best dish, a next task is to refine and improve the recipe using a research cycle. This will involve testing assumptions in the recipes to learn which steps and ingredients are necessary, proposing and testing new steps in the recipe that weren't there before, and possibly even completely rewriting the recipe if you found a more compelling way to make the dish.

### Testing Recipes

I'll finish off this metaphor by discussing two kinds of tests that are relevant when we go back to examining theories in cognition. **Logical tests** are useful for examining the internal structure of a theory to determine whether it is logically possible that the theory can do what it claims to do. This is like evaluating whether or not a recipe can make the dish it claims to make. Logical tests can often be conducted just by reasoning through the theory (or reading through the recipe). For example, it is clear by reading the nonsense recipe from above that it will not do what it claims to do. When you are visited with theoretical claims about cognitive abilities, it should be possible to read through the theory like a recipe and clearly appreciate how the claims about cognition work.

**Empirical Tests** are useful for examining components of a theory, and they typically involve experiments to measure phenomena that are associated with claims or assumptions from a theory. For example, in my favorite recipe for oven fries, one of the tips is to salt the pan that you put your potato slices on...this is supposed to help reduce the fries sticking to the pan. Let's think of "Salting the pan" as one critical part of the "theory of oven fries". How critical is this assumption? Is it necessary for making oven fries? Does salting the pan actually reduce stickiness? These questions can be answered with an experiment to address the question.

The experiment will involve making different batches of oven fries, some where the pan is salted, and others where it is not, and then measuring how much the fries stick to the pan. More formally, this experiment will involve an **independent variable** that is manipulated by me, the experimenter--the experimental manipulation is salting the pan. The manipulation will have at least two levels or conditions, so that the outcomes can be compared between them. In the **control** condition I won't add salt to the pan. In the **experimental** conditions, I will add salt to the pan. I could even try different amounts of salt if I wanted. To run the experiment I would try to follow the oven fries recipe exactly the same way for every batch of fries of that I make, with the only difference being whether or not I salted the pan. I will even make sure that each pan has the same number of potato wedges on it. Then, for each batch I will need to measure the stickiness of the fries somehow. This measurement is called the **dependent variable**, because it is supposed to depend (or be influenced by the experimental manipulation). How about this, after baking, I will turn the pan upside down. All of the fries that fall off didn't stick. Then I will count all of the fries that did stick.

I can use my observations in the form of counts to evaluate my **empirical question**, which is a kind of question that can be answered by observing what happens under controlled conditions. My question was whether salting a pan actually reduces the number of fries stuck on the pan. I can count how many fries stuck to pans that were salted, and how many fries stuck to pans that were not salted. And, then I can compare the numbers. If salting the pan doesn't really change fry stickiness, then I would expect roughly the same number of fries on salted and unsalted pans. If salting the pan reduces fry stickiness, then there should be fewer fries stuck on the salted pan than the unsalted pan. Maybe salting the pan actually does the opposite of what the theory claimed, and then there would be more fries stuck on the salted pan than the unsalted pan. If everyone in the world tried making oven fries using different kinds of potatoes, and different ovens, and different pans, and everyone found pretty much the same results, we could become fairly confident in decidedly answering this one question. Or, the results could be a little bit messy, maybe some salt works sometimes for some potatoes on some pans in some ovens, but not others...the empirical answer could be "maybe, it depends".

Because I am having fun with this recipe metaphor for science, I'm going to keep going. Let's imagine our experiment shows consistent evidence that salting the pan does reduce the number of fries stuck to the pan. By consistent evidence I mean that I ran the whole experiment a bunch of times and kept getting the same results, so I stopped running the experiment because I felt confident that the result can be trusted. For example, if someone else came over to my kitchen and did my experiment under the same conditions, they would also find that salting the pan reduces how many fries are stuck the pan. Reproducibility of results is also important in cognition, and sometimes it is a concern because there are numerous examples of reported experiments whose results have not been consistently reproducible ^[we will discuss some examples throughout the textbook and elaborate on issues of reproducibility later on].

### Making inferences about recipes

But, for sake of argument, we will assume the salting the pan trick is reproducible. Great. Now what. Let's not forget some of the larger issues at hand. Sometimes we can sucked into a long and detailed story about a specific thing-- like salting a pan of oven fries--and lose track of how this little story fits into the bigger issues. I set up the salting-the-pan experiment because it was a way to put a component of the oven fry recipe to the test. What have we learned through the process of putting this one component of the recipe to an empirical test? How are results from empirical tests used in the process of improving our explanations of the things we are testing? In my opinion, there is a long and artful dance that occurs between explanations (in the form of theory) and empirical results (in the form of data), that eventually lead them to embrace one another.

In our thought experiment, the original question of interest was "how do the best oven fries work?". What inferences about the overall recipe can we make based on the empirical test of one of its assumptions? In terms of making inferences about theoretical assumptions from data, the available inferences will be limited by how the assumptions fits in the theory, and what the pattern of data says about the assumption. Is salting-the-pan a necessary assumption for really great oven fries? That invites another empirical question that we didn't ask. Are the fries from the unsalted pans still really good? If so, then salting the pans might not be a necessary step in the recipe (even if it does reduce stickiness). What are the necessary steps from the recipe? We could spend time creating individual experiments to test whether each step and ingredient, or specific combinations of the steps and ingredients are all necessary or not necessary to make great fries. When you consider the number of steps, ingredients, and slightly different variations, and number of ways that all of these things can be combined, there are a never-ending number of experiments that could be run to empirically test assumptions of the recipe. I'm exhausted just thinking about it. If we forced ourselves to test all of the combinations we would never leave the kitchen, or do anything else.

Asking empirical questions to settle one issue can easily open new questions about other issues that may or may not be of interest. For example, demonstrating empirically that salting the pan does reduce the number of fries stuck to it, raises new questions about how stickiness works. How does salt change the stickiness of pans? The evidence that salt does change stickiness becomes a phenomena in and of itself that requires explanation, and we would need to drop into the territory of chemistry and physics to examine those issues.

### Dessert

I should bring this metaphor to a close, but here are some parting thoughts. The things that you might want out of a cooking recipe are not too different from what you might want out a theory in cognition. And, you should feel empowered to evaluate what you learn about cognition from this point of view. It is OK to be unsatisfied with a recipe for many reasons, it might be unclear, it might be complicated, it might not work very well, it might have extra unnecessary stuff; it might look pretty good until it tells you use apply some magic sauce that was never explained. Same goes for explanations of cognition, where you might be unsatisfied for similar reasons.

It is also OK to like different recipes for many reasons. Some recipes are inspiring to read and get you excited, some recipes give super-specific instructions for doing one thing really well, some recipes are surprising and make you wonder what the food would taste like, and some recipes are very insightful and show you techniques that can be used over and over again for other recipes. Same goes for explanations of cognition, where there can be different reasons to appreciate the value of a theory, even if it isn't perfect.

Last, consider the concept of truth in the metaphor between recipes and theories. In the domain of cooking and recipes is there such a thing as true recipes? Is there one true oven fries recipe? I don't think so. There are lots of oven fries recipes. They all make oven fries. Some of them make oven fries that I like more than others. Also, there is an entire world of other recipes and it is very exciting to explore all of the tasty ways that different people and cultures prepare food. What about theories in cognition? Is there one true theory of cognition? If there is, I haven't heard about it. Instead, like recipes there are lots of different theories about cognition, and it is OK to appreciate that variety as we learn about how different researchers have prepared their explanations of different cognitive abilities.
