<p>This chapter provides a broad view of some of the issues involved with describing, and tools and methods used to describe cognition and how it works. We begin to give some definition to cognition, although this definition expands across the rest of the textbook. Most of this chapter is concerned with background concepts that are important for understanding the processes by which we can create knowledge about how cognition works. This includes preliminary discussions about roles for theories and facts, philosophy of science, the scientific method and other methods for generating knowledge, and the kinds of explanations that provide more or less satisfying answers to questions about the mind.</p>

</h2>
<p>What is cognition and how does it work? These are questions I have been wondering about ever since I started doing research into human cognition. At the moment, I (Matt Crump) am a roughly early/mid-career researcher who has been conducting research on topics in cognition since about 2000-2001, where I started as an undergraduate working in cognitive psychology labs. At that time I discovered that there was a large scientific literature on human and animal cognition that went back over a hundred years. Today, that very same literature has continued to grow and grow. Perhaps I shouldn’t admit this, but even though I’ve dedicated over 20 years of my life to studying and contributing to this literature, I think I can safely say that I have way more questions about cognition than answers. In some sense, the more I learn about research into cognition, the less I feel I know about how cognition works. It’s quite possible that I am more confused about cognitive psychology now (after 20 years as a researcher), than I was before I started!</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn’t be writing this textbook, and you should instead find an “authoritative” textbook where you can trust that the author knows everything about cognition, is not confused, and is also able to compress over a hundred years of science down into engaging and readable chapters for beginners to the field. Indeed, there are many introductory textbooks to the field of Cognitive Psychology available, each offering the authors view on the field, along with their way of introducing the field to new students. So, just like those other textbooks, in this one, you will be treated to my view of cognition, and my style for presenting it to new students. The reason I am drawing attention to these issues is that there is one thing about cognition that is very clear to me: there are many different perspectives and answers to the question “what is cognition and how does it work?”</p>
<p>I would go so far as to say that it is a fact, in the year 2021, that even though cognitive psychology is a longstanding scientific discipline, that has been formally asking and answering questions about how the mind works for well over a hundred years; and even though there has been substantial progress in this field, there is nevertheless no emerging consensus view across researchers and labs about how cognition works. There are many labs and researchers and it is not uncommon for each lab or researcher to be researching their own unique phenomena, or forwarding their own preferred explanations and theories for the parts of cognition they are studying. I will develop the view across this textbook, that this kind of diversity is OK for the science of cognition; and, that a fully grown and well developed science of cognition will continue to have a great diversity of theories and perspectives about how cognition works. Although a common goal for many sciences is to arrive at a single unified theory that explains everything, even if this doesn’t happen for cognition, I think that is OK too, because many of the possible explanations that will be generated along the way will make useful contributions to understanding cognition, even if parts of their explanations are not completely true.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth vs knowledge creation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-truth-the-whole-truth-and-nothing-but-the-truth-vs-knowledge-creation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The cognitive sciences are interested in understanding how cognition works, and this could mean that the whole enterprise is trying to figure out what is true about cognition and what is false. Science is a slow moving incremental process, so over the history of the cognitive sciences there have been many false starts. Some findings have been published that are hard to replicate (so they might not be real), and there are many theories about cognitive phenomena that have been proven to be false. There are also many findings that seem pretty stable, and there are good reasons to treat them as facts; and, despite the limitations of cognitive theories, there are nevertheless some very powerful ones out there that do a commendable job at explaining aspects of cognition.</p>
<p>So, as a final thought before we get started, I’m going to give you a heads up about how this textbook will generally tell you about the story of cognition. One option is for me to sort through all of the published research on cognition (there are hundreds of thousands of published scientific manuscripts), pick all of the ones that are true, and then tell you only about the true things about cognition that we know to be true. Actually, I don’t think this is really an option at all. So, I’m not even going to attempt anything like that.</p>
<p>Instead, this textbook will tell a story about cognition that is not so obsessed with the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I don’t deny that there are so-called “truth’s” about how cognition works. Most researchers, including me, accept facts like people and animals are physical beings, and that cognition somehow emerges from biological processes. From this perspective, there must be some truths about human and animal cognition because cognition must be determined by physical properties of our physiologies. Instead of telling a story about all the true things we think we know about cognition, I’m going to back up a little up and focus the story on the process by which cognitive science creates knowledge about cognition. Sometimes cognitive science produces knowledge about cognition that is not true about people or animals, but nevertheless very useful say for creating computer intelligence or other smart technology. Similarly, it will be important to recognize that much of what cognitive science has produced over its history resembles “working draft concepts” in the large scheme of things, and very rarely fundamental truths about cognition that everyone agrees on.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What is Cognition?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-cognition"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>So, what is cognition anyway? An everyday definition involves pretty much anything to do with how your mind works. If you are reading this, then you have cognition, and as someone with cognition, I’m sure you can form your own opinions on what counts as cognition for you. This textbook is both about cognition in this everyday sense, as well as the field of cognitive psychology and the broader cognitive sciences. These domains of academic inquiry have the goal of studying cognition from many different angles to produce knowledge about how cognition works.</p>
<p>I like to think of cognition as a big list of questions about how cognitive abilities work. For example, How do you remember what you ate for breakfast? How do you remember something that happened when you were a kid? How do you learn language? How do you know how to say a sentence? How do you think your next thought? What is your imagination like? How do you learn new skills, like walking, riding a bike, playing a musical instrument, playing a sport, or a game? How do you learn new information, and how can you study more efficiently? How do you recognize peoples faces? How do you know a tree is a tree and not some other object? How do you make plans for the future? Do you have an inner voice and if so how do you use it? How do you make decisions in your daily life? What makes you prefer some music and not others? How do you control all of your body movements from moving your fingers to facial expressions? How do you pay attention to some things while ignoring others? How did you forget that phone number so fast? How did you forget what you were doing while you were in the middle of doing something? How do you learn to read? How do you know the meaning of words? How can you train your brain to get better at something? Why do you think you know a word that is just on the tip of your tongue, but yet you can’t say the word, until later it pops in your head? How many memories can a person have? What does it mean to be smart? Can anyone learn anything to a high degree of skill? How do all of these cognitive abilities develop over the lifespan? How do people understand their own cognition? How do people understand other people’s cognition? What about non-human animals, what kind of cognitive abilities do they have? Does my cat dream about me?</p>
<p>I hope you got the sense that I could have kept going with those questions, and that you could probably come with your similar kinds of questions. From my perspective, these kinds of questions are ones that cognition researchers are interested in asking and answering.</p>
<p>Most of the above questions have two things in common that make them relevant to research in cognition (or they could be rephrased to have these two things). First, they are all about a kind of cognitive ability (such as being able to remember something, attend to something, read a book, hear a word, and so on). Second, they are “how” questions, and “how” questions are all about explaining how things work. Let’s elaborate on both of these to begin answering “what is cognition?”</p>
<div id="cognitive-abilities" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Cognitive abilities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cognitive-abilities"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>What is a cognitive ability, and what makes an ability a cognitive one as opposed to a regular ability? In the first textbook to coin the phrase “Cognitive Psychology” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-neisserCognitivePsychology1967" role="doc-biblioref">Neisser, 1967</a>)</span>, Neisser defined cognition as “all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used.” This is a pretty all-encompassing definition that still captures much of what cognitive scientists continue to study today. We could use Neisser’s definition to give some definition to the concept of a cognitive ability.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don’t want to focus too much on narrowly defining cognition and what counts as cognitive abilities. We will get a better sense of what the field has studied under these terms across the chapters in the textbook. We will also see that cognitive psychologists sometimes get too hung up on making distinctions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-newellYouCanPlay1973" role="doc-biblioref">Newell, 1973</a>)</span> that can distract from the larger issues. For example, we could spend our time making a list features for what makes an ability a cognitive ability. These could include features like: involves mental effort, involves your brain, involves thinking, and so on. There will be inevitable disagreements about what features should or should not be included on the list. And, we could end up looking at lists of abilities and spend way too much time deciding how they should be categorized, rather than spending time trying to figure out how the abilities work.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Answering How questions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#answering-how-questions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is much easier to answer a “can” question about cognition, than a “how” question. For example, can people remember information like a phone number? If you have ever remembered a phone number, then you know the answer is yes. Can you forget a phone number? Yes. We don’t need the science of cognition to answer many “can”-type questions about cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>“How” questions are much harder to answer. If I asked you, “how is it that you can remember a phone number?”; or, even more incredibly, “how can you remember a whole personal experience that happened to you ten years ago?” what kind of answer would be required to explain how those abilities work? What kind of answer would be satisfying to you? In my opinion, there are two big reasons why how-questions about cognition are hard to answer. First, the cognitive ability in question (remembering, learning, attending, talking etc.) is usually extremely complex involving the interaction of many parts, so it is daunting to imagine how detailed and complicated the explanation would have to be. Second, depending on who you talk to in the cognitive sciences, you will find that there are different levels and kinds of explanation; so, in addition to doing the hard work of explaining something about cognition, you will also have to do the hard work of understanding how different levels of explanations work, and make choices about the kinds of explanations that are appropriate and satisfying for the problem at hand.</p>

</h2>
<p>The purpose of this textbook is to provide an introduction to the ways in which the cognitive sciences have attempted to answer the question “how does cognition work?” However, before we go into the details about cognition, it is worth spending time considering some of the ways this domain of science works to generate knowledge about cognition. So, in the rest of this chapter we will consider slightly different “how” questions– “how does research into cognition work? And, what kinds of things does it produce that are capable of telling us something about how cognition works?” This will include some discussion of the scientific method and other methods that are used to generate knowledge about cognition, as well as a discussion of philosophy of science that should help us better appreciate the kinds of explanations available and how well the explanations work.</p>
<p>Some of these topics are little bit abstract, and one of the principles of cognition that will be repeated across this textbook is that learning from examples is fundamental in cognition [], and also helpful for learning abstract material []. So, we will use the example of research into mental imagery as an aid for introducing some of the major ways that cognitive research works. It is also useful to have some major landmarks in mind when navigating new territory, even it is conceptual territory. So, I will organize the rest of the chapter into three big landmarks in the research landscape of cognition.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The research cycle</li>
<li>Fact and theory generation</li>
<li>Society and historical context</li>
</ol>
<p>The research cycle involves a wide variety of methods (such as the scientific method) that researchers use to test claims about cognition. Fact and theory generation are a part of the research cycle, but I gave them their own big landmark. Fact and theory generation is the process of figuring out what facts about cognition are real and in need of explanation, and then coming up with theories that explain the facts. The research cycle can be used to test factual claims and theoretical claims, which can lead researchers to discover new facts and create new theories (i.e., a cyclical process). Last, cognition research is a human activity that is embedded within a socio-historical context. The discoveries of cognitive research can have applications in society (for better and worse), and the potential prospects of these applications can in turn influence the research process by guiding researchers to spend their time on some problems as opposed to others.</p>
<p>The very broad domain of all-of-cognition is very large, and probably too difficult to ever study all at once. So, a common strategy in cognitive research is to focus inquiry onto smaller pieces of the puzzle. We will see this approach in action in this textbook, because each chapter is about different domains or parts of cognition (e.g., memory, learning, attention, etc). The rest of this chapter is set in the research domain of mental imagery. Despite the difficulties about obtaining truly objective facts about subjective experiences like mental imagery, the research cycle has been turning on this problem for well over a hundred years. There is way too much research to cover all of it in one short chapter. Instead, I will choose some research highlights to focus on three issues: getting facts about mental imagery, testing theories about mental imagery, and societal implications of the research.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Mental Imagery<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mental-imagery"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>What is mental imagery?</p>
<p>Close your eyes, and think about what you can see or hear in your “mind’s eye” or “mind’s ear.” Some people report being able to see life-like images that are extremely clear and vivid, almost as if there is no difference between what they can imagine seeing and what they can see when they are looking at something when their eyes are open. Some people report seeing less vivid mental imagery, that is more spatial in nature. For example, they could close their eyes and imagine their kitchen; but they wouldn’t “see” their kitchen as it appears when they are looking at it for real; but, they would nevertheless have some spatial sense about the shape of the kitchen, and where things are stored in the kitchen. Other people report having very little to no mental imagery.</p>
<p>For fun, I’ll tell you what I see when I close my eyes. My eyelids, and not much else… it’s pretty dark when I close my eyes. At the same, I can imagine my kitchen pretty easily, although, I wouldn’t say that I “see” it very clearly, I “see” it more spatially. However, sometimes I do “see” images that are more visual, that look like things I see when I have my eyes open. Also, I’ve had lots of dreams that seemed very visually vivid and real, just like visual experiences appear to me in waking life. So, according to me, my mental imagery is all of the above, and can include imagery about other kinds of senses, like sounds, taste, touch, and smells.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that mental imagery is a real cognitive ability, and that different people experience mental imagery in different ways. How does mental imagery work? What kind of explanation would we be looking for to answer this question? What steps could we take to start answering this question? How have prior researchers tackled these questions, and what have we learned about mental imagery? How has society been influenced by research into mental imagery and vice versa?</p>

</h2>
<p>In general, before progress can be made on all of those questions, a first step is to collect information about the features or facts about a phenomena like mental imagery. If we have no facts, there wouldn’t be much to explain. So, how do we get facts that we can trust, and collectively agree upon, about a subjective phenomena like mental imagery? My assessment is that the literature has produced many kinds of imperfect measurements that are relevant to the task of establishing facts about mental imagery. Still, a healthy amount of skepticism is required for evaluating what the findings mean. Let’s start with perhaps the most obvious way of knowing about mental imagery. Ask yourself what it is like to you, and ask other people what it is like to them.</p>
<div id="methods-of-introspection-and-subjective-report" class="section level3" number="1.6.1">

<span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Methods of Introspection and Subjective report<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#methods-of-introspection-and-subjective-report"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Mental imagery is all about the subjective experience of being in your own mind. So, by this definition, there is only one person who really knows what it is like to be you, and you are that person. So, if you want to get the facts about your own mental imagery, is it possible for you to do that?</p>
<p>One imperfect solution is called the method of introspection, which means to self-reflect on your experience of your own cognition. Introspection has been, and still is, employed as a tool by many psychologists. For example, early German psychologist Wilhem Wundt and American psychologist Edward Tichener advocated the use of introspection as a technique to generate knowledge about the mind. The related method of subjective report involves asking other people to introspect and then report on aspects of their own psychology. Subjective report methods are very common today in the form of questionnaires that ask people to make subjective judgments about their own psychology. Before considering the limitations of introspection and subjective report, let’s see an example from mental imagery research.</p>

</h3>
<p>One of the first attempts at studying mental imagery was by Sir Francis Galton <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-galtonStatisticsMentalImagery1880" role="doc-biblioref">Galton, 1880</a>)</span>. In his paper on “Statistics of mental Imagery,” Galton set out to “to define the different degrees of vividness with which different persons have the faculty of recalling familiar scenes under the form of mental pictures, and the peculiarities of the mental visions of different persons.” How did Galton go about doing this?</p>

</h4>
<p>Galton came up with the “Breakfast table task,” which is a series of structured questions about mental imagery, and then asked 100 people to answer his questions. The basic set of questions is reprinted below:</p>

<p>"Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the opposite page, think of some definite object – suppose it is your breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning – and consider carefully the picture that rises before your mind’s eye. [p. 302]</p>

<li>Illumination. – Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its brightness comparable to that of the actual scene ?</li>
<li>Definition. – Are all the objects pretty well defined at the same time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment more contracted than it is in a real scene?</li>
<li>Colouring. – Are the colours of the china, of the toast, bread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table, quite distinct and natural?"</li>

<p>Then, Galton recorded the answers that people gave and tried to make sense of them. Here are some of the answers from “100 men, at least half of whom are distinguished in science or in other fields of intellectual work.” (reprinted from his original manuscript):</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.6.2.3</span> Galton’s conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#galtons-conclusion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Before considering Galton’s conclusion, consider what he could have found, and what he might have concluded instead. For example, if everyone has the same kind of vivid visual mental imagery, he could have found very different subjective reports. In this case, everybody might have said that they have very strong and vivid visualizing powers. But, it turns out, this is not what people said. Instead, Galton’s major conclusion and potential discovery was evidence for a wide variety of individual differences in mental imagery. Some people reported having very strong powers of mental visualization, some people reported having medium abilities, and other people reported having essentially no abilities to visualize anything in their mind’s eye at all.</p>
<p>If we are attempting to explain a cognitive ability like mental imagery, and Galton’s results provide facts that we can trust, then the task of explaining mental imagery just got a little bit harder. For example, not only do we have to explain how people could visualize a picture in their minds eye, we also have to explain the facts that some people may do this differently, and some people may not be able to do it at all. This is a good example of the increasing complexity that comes along with the research process of gathering facts about a phenomena: asking questions uncovers more facts that raise more questions and require even more explanation.</p>

</h4>
<p>Galton argued that his methods were useful and appropriate to the task of measuring people’s mental imagery abilities, but these introspection and subjective report also have many shortcomings that could easily invalidate all of the results. For example, what if everybody that Galton talked to lied about their mental imagery? In this case, none of Galton’s results would be meaningful with respect to understanding mental imagery. Similarly, how accurate are people at describing their own mental imagery? If people are not very accurate, then their descriptions will not be very meaningful for describing their actual experiences. Or, what if people are having the same kinds of subjective mental imagery experiences, but they just use different words to describe the same kinds of experiences. And, of course, maybe everybody was telling the truth and there really are big differences in mental imagery across people.</p>
<p>One big issue here for establishing facts about mental imagery, is that the internal experience of mental imagery is not easy for other people to observe directly. In other domains of inquiry, direct observation can help people quickly establish a set of agreed upon facts. For example, a group of geologists can all look and point at a rock formation, and agree that the rock formation is there, and then proceed to further inspect and measure the rock formation to gather more directly observable facts about it. Galton’s method of subjective report does have some directly observable measurements, such as the words that people said about their mental imagery; but, people’s verbal statements are at best an indirect attempt to communicate an experience, and do not provide an objective lens for other observers to directly view the experience itself.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to establish objective facts about something subjective like mental imagery, how could we possibly hope to explain those facts given that we may not be able to agree on what the facts are in the first place!?! This is undoubtedly a challenge, and there many tools and methods that cognitive researchers have developed since Galton to help make progress on the issues. One common requirement for establishing facts is to show that they are reproducible. Let’s take a look a the reproducibility of some of Galton’s claims and findings</p>

</h3>
<p>Galton conducted his work in the United Kingdom throughout the last half of the 1800s, and like some of his other ideas (that we will discuss shortly), they tended to spread among psychologists in other countries. At the turn of the century, American psychologists were busy using Galton’s methods and publishing on the mental imagery abilities of college students. For example, in 1896, Armstrong <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-armstrongjrImageryAmericanStudents1894" role="doc-biblioref">Armstrong Jr, 1894</a>)</span> used the same “Breakfast Table” questions as Galton did, but gave them to students at Wesleyan University (a male college). The general pattern of results was similar to what Galton found. The students reported a wide range of mental imagery abilities, including a small proportion of students who were classified as having little to no visual imagery.</p>
<p>However, in 1902, French <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-frenchMentalImageryStudents1902" role="doc-biblioref">French, 1902</a>)</span> asked students at Vassar college (a female college) about their mental imagery abilities with a longer mental imagery questionnaire (by Tichener <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-titchenerExperimentalPsychologyManual1905" role="doc-biblioref">Titchener, 1905</a>)</span>), that was intended to improve on Galton’s original questions. The results were mostly consistent with prior results, and the Vassar students reported a wide range of different mental imagery abilities. But, one finding was not reproduced. All of the 118 students reported at least some mental imagery abilities, and none of them reported that they had zero mental imagery abilities. This could mean all of the students happened to have mental imagery abilities, or it could call into question the claims that some people do not have mental imagery. One possibility is that the results depend on the questionnaire. Galton had 10 questions about mental imagery, Tichener had almost 90 questions that covered imagery for more senses, and potentially gave students more opportunities to claim that they had at least some mental imagery. Perhaps, Galton and Armstrong would have found all of their participants reporting at least a little bit of mental imagery if they had used the newer questionnaire by Tichener.</p>

<p>Let’s skip over a century and ask what recent research on mental imagery looks like. In 2010, Zeman and colleagues reported a case of a patient with “imagery generation disorder” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-zemanLossImageryPhenomenology2010" role="doc-biblioref">A. Z. Zeman et al., 2010</a>)</span> that got picked up in the media. Several people who heard about the finding contacted the researchers to let them know that they also did not experience visual imagery. This led the research group to begin examining these claims in more detail and in 2015 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-zemanLivesImageryCongenital2015" role="doc-biblioref">A. Zeman et al., 2015</a>)</span> they did something very similar to what Galton did; namely, ask people questions about the vividness of their mental imagery. They used a newer questionnaire developed to assess the vividness of visual imagery <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-marksVisualImageryDifferences1973" role="doc-biblioref">Marks, 1973</a>)</span>; and gave it to the people who claimed they had no visual imagery. Perhaps not surprisingly, those same people gave answers to the questionnaire that were consistent with their claims that they had visual imagery. Zeman coined the term “aphantasia” to describe the condition of having little to no mental imagery.</p>
<p>The media attention to Zeman’s work on aphantasia caused a great of deal of interest across the world. One of the research participants 2015 study created the <a href="https://aphantasia.com">Aphantasia Network</a> website, which has grown into a large online community for people with aphantasia. By 2020 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-zemanPhantasiaPsychologicalSignificance2020" role="doc-biblioref">A. Zeman et al., 2020</a>)</span>, Zeman’s group had been contacted by 14,000 people who either claimed they had aphantasia, or the opposite – extremely vivid and life-like mental imagery, termed “hyperphantasia.” Some of the claims are really quite extraordinary. For example, in a 2021 New York Times article <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-zimmerManyPeopleHave2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zimmer, 2021</a>)</span>, cognitive neuroscientist Joel Pearson claimed that ‘hyperphantasia could go far beyond just having an active imagination…and that “People [with hyperphantasia] watch a movie, and then they can watch it again in their mind, and it’s indistinguishable.”.’</p>
<p>I can’t accurately replay a whole movie in my head. That is pretty incredible. To me, this claim is so incredible that I wonder if the person was exaggerating their ability a little bit. Although I am skeptical, there is no shortage of people accomplishing astounding, and objectively verifiable feats of cognition. Daniel Tammet <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-DanielTammet2021" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Daniel <span>Tammet</span>,”</span> 2021</a>)</span> is famous for breaking the European record for correctly reciting from memory, the first 22,514 digits of the number pi. So, if Daniel Tammet can accurately “replay” the digits of pi for five hours, maybe someone else can replay a whole movie in their mind. Again, the role of direct observation comes into play for lending support to an extraordinary claim. The fact that Daniel could say the digits of pi out loud for other observers to hear, under controlled conditions (where those observers could verify he wasn’t cheating somehow), makes it easier to believe that Daniel’s ability is real. Similarly, if there were more direct methods to test claims about extreme differences in mental imagery abilities, this would lend more support to those extraordinary claims.</p>

<p>We have just surveyed a few examples of research into mental imagery abilities. These examples were chosen to highlight some of the challenges with establishing facts about cognitive abilities. I deliberately chose a tough example like mental imagery where it is inherently difficult to obtain clear, objective facts, that everyone can agree upon. So, before we consider an example of theorizing about mental imagery, and the larger task of explaining how an ability like mental imagery works; let’s consider the kinds of facts that we have so far, and the role that they play in the research cycle.</p>
<p>I consider the work we reviewed so far as preliminary <em>exploratory research</em> that has been on a fact-finding mission. From Galton to Zemon, the questionnaires have been developed to ask “what” questions, rather than “how” questions. And, it is of course useful to establish facts about “what mental imagery is like,” before developing and testing theories about “how mental imagery works.”</p>
<p>What facts about mental imagery can we say have been established by the research? First, reasonable people can have different answers to this question, which adds to the complexity of trying to explain cognitive abilities like mental imagery. To give my perspective, I’ll list a few questions about mental imagery facts, and discuss what kind of evidence we have for the facts.</p>
<p>Is mental imagery a real cognitive ability? Are there individual differences in mental imagery abilities? Do some people really have zero mental imagery abilities? Do some people have truly life-like mental imagery?</p>
<p>The research we reviewed all used introspection and subjective report methods (questionnaires) to ask people questions about their own subjective experience of mental imagery. These methods have limitations as we discussed previously: people might be lying, inaccurate, inattentive, unable to describe their own experience, or describe similar experiences differently. As a consequence, the quality of the results is limited by the the quality of the measurement tool. I would not claim that the questionnaire data provides clear, objective facts about a person’s internal subjective experience of mental imagery. At the same time, I would agree that the research has produced some objective facts about how people describe their own mental imagery. Across centuries, and thousands of participants, people consistently claim that mental imagery is real for them, and similar proportions of people consistently claim that they extremely different kinds of mental imagery abilities. So, if you were to make your own questionnaire to ask random people on the street about their mental imagery abilities, what do you think would happen based off of the existing research we have discussed? My prediction would be that you would find the same kinds of results that Galton did in 1880, and Zeman did in the 2010s.</p>
<p>Some of the big takeaways for me from reviewing this slice of the literature are the following. First, asking people about their own experience is a useful thing to do, especially when you want to learn something about their subjective experience. People make consistent claims about mental imagery, and provide preliminary forms of subjective evidence about features of their own mental imagery. There are limitations due to subjective report, and it would be useful to develop alternative tools to measure different aspects of mental imagery in a more objective way.</p>

<p>The cognitive sciences is not only concerned with discovering the facts about cognitive abilities like mental imagery, it is also interested in explaining how the abilities work. Explanations can take different forms, and across the textbook we will encounter relatively simple claims about how something might work, to well-developed verbal theories, to highly specified computer simulations that propose working algorithms for specific cognitive abilities. And, throughout, I will encourage us to keep wondering about what kind of explanation would be satisfying to you, to explain how different cognitive abilities work.</p>
<p>I think I can safely say that as of right now, there is no broadly accepted theory or explanation about how mental imagery works. As we already discussed, there isn’t really great consensus on the features of mental imagery itself, so the absence of a theory isn’t too surprising. However, there has been a great deal of theoretical debate about mental imagery, and this debate provides a really nice example to discuss how theories and explanations are used in cognitive research.</p>

</h3>
<p>In the previous section, I mentioned that we skipped about a hundred years of research. And there were some general trends in psychology that shaped how researchers asked questions about mental imagery. Some of the general trends correspond to gradual transitions between “schools” of thought in psychology. At the beginning of psychology in the USA, Titchener (1867-1927) developed the “Structuralist” school of thought, and used careful, but subjective, introspection techniques to interrogate and discover individual components of cognition. Behaviorism was another school of thought that favored asking questions that could only be answered with objective measures of behavior. Some “hard-core” behaviorists like B.F. Skinner (1904-1990), claimed that internal processes of the mind were simply outside the boundaries of scientific inquiry, and that psychology should only study observable phenomena like behavior. So, whole topics like mental imagery received less attention by researchers. However, in the 1950s 60s, and 70s, there was a “cognitive revolution” of sorts, and more psychologists returned to asking questions about cognitive abilities, including mental imagery.</p>
<p>Curiously, when mental imagery began re-appearing in scientific journals in the 1960s and 1970s, it came back as a potential explanation of other cognitive abilities. For example, by the 1960s there was already a very large literature on human memory abilities, which was often focused on examining factors that influence how well people can remember verbal stimuli like words. In 1963, Allan Paivio <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-paivioLearningAdjectivenounPaired1963" role="doc-biblioref">Paivio, 1963</a>)</span> considered the possibility that mental imagery might be involved in tasks where people attempt to remember words from a list. He suggested that experiencing strong mental imagery when reading a word could make it easier to remember that word later on. Similarly, other words might not be associated with strong mental imagery, and those kinds of words might be harder to remember later on. Paivio also provided some experimental evidence that was consistent with the idea that mental imagery is involved in memory abilities.</p>

<p>Paivio used a standard paired-associate learning task. He ran experiments on elementary school students, and on college students, and found similar results. Here’s what happened if you were a subject in the experiment.</p>
<p>Everyone was given pairs of words to remember for a later memory test. Each pair involved an adjective and a noun, like “Ingenious-Inventor.” Importantly, there were two different kinds of word-pairs, and this was the critical manipulation in the experiment. The manipulation was whether the noun was more concrete or more abstract. Examples of the two kinds of word pairs are presented below:</p>

</table></div>
<p>What makes a noun more concrete or abstract? I think this remains a good question, and the distinction isn’t always so clear to me. The general idea was that concrete words are potentially more evocative, meaningful, and easier to mentally image than abstract words. For example, hearing or reading the word “Magician” might cause you to think of a colorful magician’s hat, whereas the word “Discourse” might not bring to mind specific mental images. Paivio chose the words that he considered more concrete and more abstract when constructing the lists for his experiment.</p>
<p>During the encoding phase, the experimenter read lists of 16 word pairs out loud, with a two second pause in between. Half of the word pairs had a concrete noun, and the other half had an abstract noun. During the memory test, the experimenter read out only the first word from each pair (the adjective), and participants were asked to remember the word it was paired with and write it down. If you heard the word “Amazing,” and you were given the concrete pair, the correct answer would be to write down “Circus.” If you were given the abstract pair then the correct answer would be “Crusade.”</p>
<p>The empirical question was whether people would have better memory for the concrete nouns compared to the abstract nouns, and this is exactly what Paivio found. In the second experiment, he found that people remembered on average about 4.5 words correctly if they were concrete nouns, but only about 2 words correctly if they were abstract nouns. This is only a difference of 2.5 words, but the result seemed to be consistent across 120 university students, and it suggested that something about the concrete versus abstract quality of these words caused differences in memory performance for the words.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.7.2.1</span> Paivio’s explanations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#paivios-explanations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Paivio entertained different explanations of his results, and the way he related results to explanations is fairly common in cognitive psychology. In the introduction of his paper he referred to new ideas about how memory might work from Miller, Galanter, &amp; Pribram <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-millerPlansStructureBehavior1960" role="doc-biblioref">Miller et al., 1960</a>)</span>, who suggested that mental imagery could help people efficiently organize, store, and then later retrieve information in memory. And, he raised the possibility that mental imagery was the reason why participants remembered concrete (more imageable) better than abstract nouns (less imageable). Let’s call this the mental imagery explanation.</p>
<p>However, Paivio actually concluded that the “concept of mediating imagery…may be unneccesary” to explain his results. Instead, de described another possibility that memory performance was being determined by pre-existing associations between the word pairs. For example, some words are more likely to follow other words, and people may have different learned associations between different words. For example, it’s possible that I have a stronger learned association between “Noisy-Trumpet” (which was a concrete pair) than “Noisy-Gossip” (which was an abstract pair). If I was in this experiment and was given the cue word “Noisy,” I might be better able to remember “Trumpet” not because I formed an mental of image of a “Trumpet,” but because “Noisy” was already more strongly associated with “Trumpet” in the first place. Let’s call this the pre-existing association explanation.</p>

</h4>
<p>More interestingly, Paivio ended his paper with a proposal for another experiment that could put these two explanations to the test. This is an instructive example of how the research cycle is used in cognition to refine questions from one experiment to another. A key ingredient is having at least two tentative explanations of the experimental results that make different testable predictions. Paivio’s were the mental imagery explanation and the pre-existing association explanation. The next ingredient is researcher creativity to come up with a new experiment that is capable of putting the predictions to the test.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that there was a drug that immediately turned off everyone’s mental imagery. If mental imagery is responsible for people remembering concrete nouns better than abstract nouns, and if we repeated the experiment but gave people the drug to turn off their mental imagery, then what should happen to memory for the words? According to the mental imagery explanation, the difference in memory performance between concrete and abstract words should disappear. This is because mental imagery would be “turned off,” and would not be able to cause any differences in memory between the words. If there were still differences in memory between the words, this would be good evidence against the mental imagery explanation.</p>
<p>Paivio didn’t have a magic wand to make mental imagery turn off, so he suggested a differnet approach, to control for aspects of the pre-existing association explanation. He proposed a new experiment could be repeated with random pairings between adjectives and concrete versus abstract nouns. For example, Noisy-Trumpet isn’t very random because the adjective noisy happens to be meaningful for some trumpets, and there could easily be pre-existing associations between Noisy and Trumpet. However, the influence of pre-existing associations could potentially be eliminated by randomly assigning unrelated adjectives to the nouns. If the advantage for remembering concrete over abstract nouns persisted under these new control conditions, then Paivio would have evidence that pre-existing associations do not explain his findings. And, perhaps the concept of “mediating imagery” would be necessary to explain these influences on memory for words.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Theories of Mental Representation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theories-of-mental-representation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before evaluating the kinds of explanations of cognitive abilities we have seen so far, let’s do one more example from the literature. Throughout the 60s and 70s, there were many other studys like Paivio’s that invoked the concept of mental imagery as potentially necessary to explain how people were performing different kinds of tasks. In 1973, Zenon Pylyshyn <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-pylyshynWhatMindEye1973" role="doc-biblioref">Pylyshyn, 1973</a>)</span> published a critique of the emerging mental imagery explanations, and initiated a lengthy debate with Stephen Kosslyn about the form of mental representations. This debate led to a number of experiments attempting to provide evidence in favor and/or against either position.</p>
<p>I will use the terms pictorial versus propositional to distinguish between the two theoretical ideas about mental representations. The pictorial representation idea is that perceptual experiences and mental imagery experiences are represented in somewhat similar formats. This could imply that perception is involved somehow in mental imagery, and that mental imagery might behave similarly to perception in some circumstances. The term “pictorial representation” is meant to evoke the really simple idea that perceiving and imagining an image might rely on closely related mental representations.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the propositional representation assumption is that mental representations are really fundamentally different from our perceptual experiences. A propositional system uses symbols and rules for their combination and recombination to describe mental representations. We’ll see a more concrete example shortly, but propositional systems aren’t too different from using words to describe an image. A paragraph of words to describe an image involves word symbols and rules for putting words together in order. A well-written paragraph can do an OK job of representing a visual scene. And, it is hopefully clear enough that using words to describe an image involves a totally different kind of representation, than say taking a picture of the image. On this view, people don’t actually have pictures in their mind, instead cognitive abilities are controlled by propositional knowledge and representation systems.</p>
<p>The pictorial and propositional ideas about cognitive representation are two very different takes on the fabric of cognition. Is our cognition running on picture-like or perception-like representations of our experiences with the world? Or, is our cognition running on totally abstract propositional codes that are qualitatively different from perception? Do these alternative ideas about mental representation make different predictions? If so, can the predictions be tested with experiments? To answer these questions, let’s look at an experiment using the mental chronometry technique.</p>

<p>In 1978, Stephen Kosslyn <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-kosslynVisualImagesPreserve1978" role="doc-biblioref">Kosslyn et al., 1978</a>)</span> did some clever experiments on scanning of mental images. Here’s the quick and dirty version. Imagine a map of the USA, now zoom in on New York City and imagine a little black dot hovering over the city. Whenever you are ready, zoom that little black dot all the way over to Los Angeles. How long it did it take you to mentally scan across your mental image of the map? Kosslyn created a similar task to measure the time it took people to do similar kinds of scans across a mental image. The interesting part of the study was that he asked people to scan between two locations that had different distances. For example, I could have asked you to mentally travel from New York City to Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia or Boston. On a real map, each of those cities are different distances away from each other. The empirical question was whether or not the time it took to scan from one location to another would depend on how far apart the locations were, even if people were scanning mentally projected images in their own mind.</p>

</h2>
<p>What are the goals of the cognitive sciences and research in cognitive psychology? Who has been involved in setting those goals, are the goals useful, and what goals are being missed? What kind of questions about cognition have already been asked by researchers? What were the scientific as well as social-historical reasons for why those researchers asked those questions? What answers were found, and how were they informative or not informative about how cognition works? How do the measurements and tools that researchers use to ask questions influence the kind of picture they build about how cognition works. What kinds of questions about cognition are not being asked that should be asked? Why are they not being asked? Should society invest in cognitive research? Are there research questions that should not be asked because the return on investment would not be very high? How should society decide whether or not to proceed with different kinds of research? Should research be done only if it has an applied benefit to society?</p>

Let me consider some explanations for the fact that I can remember my own phone number. How can I do this? Let's try this explanation on for size: I have a memory system in my brain, and I put my phone number into my memory system, and that's why I can remember my phone number. 

I personally don't find that explanation very satisfying. That story doesn't tell me what a memory system is, how it works, how my brain accomplishes the job of this memory system, or how I do something like put a phone number in there and get it out again. That explanation raised more questions that it answered.

As we will see later in the chapters on memory research, sometimes we will encounter explanations that are not too different from the above. For example, one might explain the ability to hold on to a phone number in your head for a couple seconds (before forgetting it) in terms of putting the phone number into a short term memory system that is only capable of holding information for a limited amount of time. Alternatively, the ability to remember an event from ten years ago could be explained by a different kind of memory system, like a long term memory system that is capable of holding information for a long period of time. These explanations aren't too different from the one above because they sidestep most of the explanatory work. For example, how does the short term memory system work? How does the long-term memory system work?


Even if you haven't learned much about cognitive psychology, you may have heard about the concepts of short term memory and long term memory. 

I'm bringing these concepts up to raise a point about how explanations are forwarded in cognitive research. 

If we have evidence that people can remember some things for a little bit of time, and other things for a long time; this kind of evidence could potentially by explained by two different kinds of systems that allow people to remember things. One system for a short amount of time, and another of a long amount of time. However, it is extremely important to recognize that there ar


For the record, I wouldn't count the above as an explanation at all, instead rather than explaining how I remember a phone number, I brought a few other ideas into the mix and




As a result, cognition as science has progressed somewhat differently from other sciences. 

Before we really get started, there are several reasons why it is important to recognize that there are a diversity of views on cognition. 

Claims vs reality

Theory, phenomena







Over the course of the textbook some of the reasons I am confused will hopefully become more clear. However, I'm admitting to


that I come to understand how research in



What is my "framework for presenting cognition?

Claims about cognition: making them and evaluating

Theories and explanation

Abilities vs process-based explanations

The tools you use shape the picture you draw...

Cognition is a diverse body of research where people have applied to tools of measurment to answer questions about cognition. The present landscape and history of cognition partly depends on social historical context, individual motivations of researchers, funding agency missions, and tools used. In addition to what is normally included in "cognitive psychology", if we take a wider view, many other observations outside of lab and "scientific" domain of cognition, are and should be relevant to asking and answering questions about cognition.


NOTES:

There is a lot of research in cognition, and it doesn't all fit together in a logical, orderly fashion. The story of cognitive research is not one succesfully building cumulative knowledge with every published paper. It is much more confusing and complicated...full of interesting tidbits and even many failures.

Truth and facts vs. Theoretical Explanation and Tentative results

Cognition has no facts
Cognitive processes are not real...They are all theorized.
