CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO BE FINALIZED FOR FALL 2021

This will be an open-educational textbook for teaching introductory cognition at the undergraduate level.

If you are a student in my class and have questions about what's going on in class, then please ask me or email me.

If you are a student interested in using these materials, and you are not in my class, and you don't know where to begin, then I hope this little overview is helpful. I think there are enough breadcrumbs here to work your way through the course material on your own.

## Copying the textbook

This textbook was written in R-Studio, using R Markdown, and compiled into a web-book format using the bookdown package. In general, I thank the larger R community for all of the amazing tools they made.

All of the source code for compiling the book and all of the other course resources is available in the GitHub repository for this book:

<https://github.com/CrumpLab/cognition>

In principle, anybody could fork or otherwise download this repository. Load the .Rproj file in R-studio compile the entire book. The individual .rmd files for each chapter could be edited for content and style to better suit your needs.

If you want to contribute to this version of the textbook, you could make pull requests on GitHub, or discuss issues and make requests on the issues tab.

Note to self to come back here with a quick video rundown of this process.
