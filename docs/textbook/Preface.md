CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO BE FINALIZED FOR FALL 2021

This will be an open-educational textbook for teaching introductory cognition at the undergraduate level. 

## Purpose and Motivation

TO make an OER textbook for cognition that,

- free textbook for students
- copiable and refinable over time
- "next gen" textbook?
- responsive pedagogy?

## About the Author(s)

At the moment (summer 2021), Dr. Matthew Crump is about to write this textbook so that his students can use it for an introductory undergraduate course in Cognitive Psychology in Fall 2021. Given that this textbook will be released on a creative commons license (see below); I hope to, and have plans to, recruit additional contributors who will help improve this content over time.

Crump became interested in cognition as an undergraduate at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, while working as a research assistant in the labs of Dr. John Vokey, and & Dr. Scott Allen. He completed his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology in 2007 at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Milliken, and several other fantastic mentors (Dr. Lorraine Allan, Dr. Lee Brooks, Dr. Laurel Trainor, Dr. Shepard Siegel). He then worked as postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Gordon Logan at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, before beginning as Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York in 2011. Crump currently runs the the [Computional Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College](https://www.crumplab.com). He has published research on several domains in cognition including learning, memory, attention, skilled-performance, contingency judgment, computational modeling, semantic memory, and other topics. He has also contributed to and authored a few other [open-educational resources for psychologists](https://www.crumplab.com/Books.html).
