Eugenics ideology shaped history mental health treatment. People mental illness treated genetically inferior, negative eugenics used prevent people mental illness reproducing. One strategy institutionalize patients mental hospitals distant locations–prevent breeding general public. Another strategy forcibly sterilize patients ensure never reproduce. example, United States passed compulsory sterilization laws “defectives” X states.Eugenics reinforced existing forms racism several ways. White eugenicists concerned “white race” degenerate mixed “inferior” non-white races. America, eugenicists supported increased segregation whites blacks, limit inter-marriage; , supported miscegenation laws make inter-marriage illegal.Eugenics highly concerned fertility control issues. result, eugenics overlapped progressive movements, women’s movement legalize abortion. example, Margaret Sanger, founder planned parenthood, also eugenicist. Abortion welcome tool eugenics used terminate pregnancies resulting eugenically “defective” inferior offspring. Margaret Sanger, like eugenicists time America, also involved white supremacy movement, promoted views giving talks white supremacy groups. Many modern institutions organizations eugenic legacies past, notable planned parenthood recently begun publicly acknowledging reckoning history.30Eugenics involved education numerous sometimes unexpected ways. example, playground movement, debated role form children’s play development, advocated schools include playgrounds, mired eugenics.31 Gifted school programs created eugenicists []. Standardized testing invented widely promoted eugenicists [].One notorious outcomes eugenics movement occurred Germany world war II. America eugenics societies, like Human Betterment Foundation, Germany’s eugenic movement established beginning 1905 “Deutsche Gesellschaft für Rassenhygiene,” “German Society Racial Hygiene.” , eugenic goals included creating purified superior white race, goals acted upon committing atrocities like holocaust. precursors Nazi eugenics program already well-established eugenicists countries. example, English statistician Karl Pearson (inventor Pearson’s correlation co-efficient) Galton’s protege, became first “Galton Chair National Eugenics” University College London, Galton’s death 1911.
