Another strategy forcibly sterilize patients ensure never reproduce. example, United States passed compulsory sterilization laws “defectives” X states.Eugenics reinforced existing forms racism several ways. White eugenicists concerned “white race” degenerate mixed “inferior” non-white races. America, eugenicists supported increased segregation whites blacks, limit inter-marriage; , supported miscegenation laws make inter-marriage illegal.Eugenics highly concerned fertility control issues. result, eugenics overlapped progressive movements, womens movement legalize abortion. example, Margaret Sanger, founder planned parenthood, also eugenicist.

Alfred Binet French psychologist, published Binet-Simon test (student Theodore Simon) 1905 []. Lewis Terman American psychologist Stanford, popularized Binet’s test America [], hence modern combination Stanford-Binet. Although Binet often credited creating first intelligence test, one trying make tests intelligence; , said won race.Psychologists eugenics movement since Galton, trying develop intelligence years. Remember, eugenics movement strongly desired scientifically credible tests identify whether person inferior superior intelligence. Lewis Terman also prominent eugenicist (member Human Betterment Foundation) thought testing mental abilities schoolchildren help isolate “defective” children society (couldn’t reproduce), identify gifted children groomed national leaders. Terman wrote schoolchildren , “safe predict near future intelligence tests bring tens thousands high-grade defectives surveillance protection society. ultimately result curtailing reproduction feeble-mindedness elimination enormous amount crime, pauperism, industrial inefficiency…number children superior ability approximately great number feeble-minded. future welfare country hinges, small degree, upon right education superior children.”(Terman, 1916).Galton’s research individual differences vividness mental imagery 1880, example early attempts (case inventor eugenics) measure mental abilities associated intelligence. several attempts develop mental tests throughout 1890s psychologists inspired Galton. example, James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944), published “Mental tests Measurements” 1890 []. Cattell made numerous contributions American psychology, continues honored Association Psychological Sciences (APS) “James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award” lifetime achievement. Cattell also strong proponent eugenics.first paragraph Cattell’s paper:“Psychology attain certainty exactness physical sciences, unless rests foundation experiment measurement. step direction made applying series mental tests measurements large number individuals. results considerable scientific value discovering constancy mental processes, interdependence, variation different circumstances.

Many tests became useful theorizing individual psychological processes work.1896, Cattell moved Pennsylvania New York City, published measurements Columbia university students (Cattell & Farrand, 1896). today’s standards, Cattell’s test likely raise privacy concerns planning data collected. Cattell reported statistics hair eye color, height weight, head-size, breathing capacity, color-blindness, vision, color preferences, hearing, pitch-perception, skin-sensation, hand-strength, reaction-time, perception time space, memory, mental imagery. addition, examiner made separate judgments students quality (physical goodness, good student, level intellectual ability, strong-etc.), based professional opinion. Finally, students given lengthy questionnaire report family history, medical history, daily behaviors, preferences (’s favorite novel, gives pleasure, etc.). Cattell concludes science proceed determine interrelations measurements, much knowing one thing person can predict something else . also concludes “must use measurements study development individual race, disentangle complex factors heredity environment.” important thing science can guide development man.Several psychologists inspired Galton also publishing results mental tests around time, including Hugo Munsterberg (Munsterberg, 1891), J. Allen Gilbert (Gilbert, 1895), Emil Kraepelin (Kraepelin, 1895). Alfred Binet among psychologists interested mental testing, well published famous test, critiqued existing literature mental testing 1895 (Nicolas et al., 2014). Binet pointed tests measuring physical ability (like grip strength) basic sensory abilities; , rarely measured higher mental abilities. Binet proposed individual differences higher mental abilities measured simple tests, tests challenged people use higher order mental abilities. proposed tests Memory–drawing geometric shape memory, reproducing sentence memory, memory musical notes, memory color, memory 12 objects–tests Mental Imagery; Imagination; Attention– duration attention, size attentional field, performing multiple tasks –tests understanding–give definition, criticize sentence–tests suggestibility; Aesthetic feeling–persons preferences, artists?–tests Moral Feelings; muscular power; motor skill glance.Binet might predicted, Cattell’s mental testing program failed measure differences higher level mental abilities. Cattell used measurements predict outcomes, interested whether mental tests students predict grades college. Grades college courses presumably measured something students general intelligence.
