<p>This chapter overviews <strong>information processing</strong> as a concept in cognition. I mentioned at the beginning of this textbook, that Ulrich Neisser<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;who wrote the first textbook called &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in 1967&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>124</sup></a> defined cognition as “all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-neisserCognitivePsychology1967" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Neisser, 1967&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>125</sup></a></span> Neisser’s definition embraces the information processing tradition in cognition. Sensory input contains “information” about the world, and cognition is characterized as the “processing” of that information. However, just like there were many forms and ideas about behaviorism, there are different forms and ideas about information processing in cognition. We will examine the notions of <em>processing stages</em>, <em>information</em>, and <em>capacity limitations</em>, which became popular research topics around the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>Some alliterative themes about cognitive research are also introduced. We begin the chapter with the <em>four Rs</em>: a theme suggesting that explanations in cognition are guided by metaphors to technological revolutions throughout history. In the main body, we look at information processing stages in cognition in terms of an assembly-line metaphor from the industrial revolution. Then, we examine newer perspectives on information processing inspired by computational metaphors from the digital revolution. At the end of the chapter I introduce the <em>four Ms</em>: Metaphor, Mechanism, Method, and Multiplicity. Cognitive psychology is full of metaphors for cognitive mechanisms, packed with different methods, and although it can be collected under a title like “Cognitive psychology,” it can also be viewed as a multiplicity, rather than a mono-dimensional research enterprise with unitary goals.</p>

</h2>
<p>“Revolution” is used to describe periods in history where some innovation led to dramatic changes in society. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">industrial revolution</a> in Western Europe and America involved creating large-scale machines and factories to mechanize the means of production; and, is identified as launching the world into an unprecedented period of sustained growth (e.g., population growth, socio-economic growth). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution">second industrial revolution</a> (AKA technological revolution), brought the introduction of electricity, telephones for communication, planes, trains, and automobiles for transportation, and new systems for infrastructure like sewage and water supply networks. Eras associated with the introduction of technology are also described in terms of ages, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Age">machine age</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age">atomic age</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Age">jet age</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age">space age</a>. A more recent revolution was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution">digital revolution</a> involving introduction of computer technology, which led into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">information age</a>. According to wikipedia, the next age could be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_age">imagination age</a>, where computer technology will allow for an immersive virtual reality experience, and the economy will be primarily driven by “imagination work.”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Psychologists use “revolutionary” terms to describe historical periods of research in psychology. For example, the “cognitive revolution” generally refers to the period of experimental psychology following “radical behaviorism.” The figurative imagery implies that “cognitive psychologists” rebelled and overthrew the “behaviorist orthodoxy,” but there was no abrupt transition. The elements of the so-called “cognitive revolution” are less obvious, and cognitive and historical psychologists debate the meaning of the term.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-greenwoodUnderstandingCognitiveRevolution1999" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Greenwood, J.

<p>I juxtapose the technological revolutions in relation to cognition primarily for metaphorical purposes. As I will describe briefly in the next section, metaphors are very commonly used to describe how cognition works. We will use technological revolutions as metaphors to describe concepts of “information processing” in cognition.</p>

<p>A major innovation of the industrial revolutions was the introduction of machines and factories to automate production. These are physical devices that process and transform raw materials into other refined states, that are further transformed and or assembled into goods or final products. For example, a factory assembly-line for making crayons involves successive processing stages, such as: heating wax in vat, coloring and stirring the liquid, filtering, pouring and drying and forming the wax into malleable rolls, extruding the rolls of colored wax through perforated metal plates (with holes the size of crayons), drying the newly formed crayons, and placing them in machines to wrap and package them. The assembly-line metaphor is also used in cognition, and refers to the idea that there are separate stages of processing that transform the “raw materials” of sensation into the “final products” of cognition and action.</p>

</h3>
<p>A major innovation of the digital revolution was the introduction of computing technology. The rise of the computer sciences also occurred in tandem with the growth of modern cognitive psychology. For example, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science">cognitive sciences</a>” are considered an interdisciplinary discipline with major contributions from and cross-fertilization of ideas between cognitive psychology, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience and anthropology. Like the factory assembly line, computers have been used as prominent metaphors for cognition. Across this and remaining chapters we will encounter several different computer metaphors for cognition. Sometimes cognitive theories are very literal with the metaphor, and cognition is broken down into parts resembling actual physical components of a digital computer. In other cases, cognition is described in terms of more abstract computational processes and algorithms rather than concrete components.</p>

This could go in the modeling chapter?

The behaviorists we just finished reading about successfully squeezed in the study of behavior as a topic of inquiry in its own right. They did this by criticizing mentalism on one side for being unscientific (lacking objectivity and too metaphysical); but, they also had to contend with physiologists on the other side. Physiology was not lacking objectivity-- there were liquids, organic tissues, and electrical impulses that could be readily observed. The behaviorists sought to legitimize the objective study of behavior at a macroscopic level, while conceding that physiological processes were obviously causing the behavior at a microscopic level. In distinguishing between behavioral and physiological levels of analysis, behaviorism also made a case against needing to justify itself in terms of lower-level mechanisms. For example, Skinner's system had no mechanisms for any of the behaviors in the system. There were no physical counterparts to reflex strength, or to a reflex reserve. These were not mechanisms, they were just terms he used in his descriptive system. Skinner chose terms that loosely referred to physical entities, but did not extend the metaphors any further. Notably, Skinner argued that the goal was not to explain the mechanisms of behavior, but instead to control and manipulate behavior, and his system was capable of doing that without referring to mechanisms.

</h2>
<p>Our first metaphorical theme is between cognition and machines in the industrial revolution. We have already seen examples of the metaphor. For example, Descartes likened human and animal physiology to a complicated plumbing machine, like the one he saw in the royal gardens. However, Descartes was a dualist who argued that the biological machine of the human body was merely a receptacle for psychic forces. Nevertheless, he inspired physiological psychology and modern neuroscience, which have the aims of explaining cognitive processes in terms of their physical/bio-chemical substrates.</p>
<p>Machines offer a reductive perspective on explanation, where the goal is to explain how the parts of a machine work together to produce the behavior of the machine. Man-made machines are physical contraptions whose actions obey the known physical laws of the universe, and whose various states are determined by how the machine is assembled and connected together. Presumably, the person(s) who put a machine together in some sense understood the machine well enough to put it together and make it work. At the same time, I don’t know every detail of how much of the technology I use in daily life works. However, I assume that someone can explain how my phone works. Similarly, if humans encountered an alien technology, and no human knew how it worked, then I would guess that many people would attempt to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse-engineer</a>” the machine to figure out how it works. Reverse-engineering involves de-constructing an existing machine into its constituent parts to figure out how the machine works. For that matter, humans and animals are space creatures living on the planet earth, and research in psychology and neuroscience is attempting to “reverse-engineer” how our biological machines work.</p>
<p>Machines set a compelling standard for explanation, especially if the standard is to demonstrate explanation by successfully manufacturing a working machine. For example, if the inner workings of the machine of cognition can be “explained” to this standard, then along with other technology, cognition could be manufactured and innovated upon. By analogy, this could include ways to repair, restore, and preserve cognition, as well as create new ways for cognition to work and function. As with the prospects of behavioral engineering, cognitive technologies also raise a host of ethical questions.</p>
<p>At the same time, psychology does not always have the goal of achieving a machine-based explanation. For example, some of the behaviorists in the previous chapter deliberately side-stepped mechanistic explanations as a goal. For example, Skinner acknowledged that behavior was ultimately rooted in physical mechanisms, but he argued that behavior itself could also be studied at a macroscopic level, without referring to it’s microscopic mechanisms. He sometimes used terms that loosely referred to mechanisms. For example, a “reflexes” had “strength,” and were emitted after some “impulse” reached a “threshold.” All of these terms could refer to various physical mechanisms; however, Skinner was careful to say that none of them were intended to refer to any real mechanism. They were simply abstract and arbitrary terms in his system that he could have chosen different names for. As a result, many components of Skinner’s theory were not intended to be explained at a lower-level.</p>
<p>For example, you might ask, how does an impulse surpass a threshold and trigger a reflex, what is the mechanism? In Skinner’s system this question could be viewed as incoherent by definition. He defined those terms not to have any reference to physical mechanisms. Of course, it is possible to wonder about what physiological mechanisms do give rise to the behaviors in Skinner’s descriptive system, but the investigation of such mechanisms was not in the same domain as behaviorism.</p>
<p>In my view, behaviorists had an awkward relationship with mechanistic explanations. They were critical of domains that lacked mechanisms, such as mentalistic and introspectionist psychology; but, also carefully avoided having to describe mechanisms for their domain of psychology. Instead, they were content with terms that had metaphorical connotations of mechanisms, as long as the terms were operationally defined and useful for a descriptive system of behavior.</p>
<p>As we step past the behaviorist era in to the cognitive one, we will see a shift in explanatory style from purely descriptive systems to a greater emphasis on mechanistic lines of questioning and mechanistic accounts of cognitive processes. This shift sometimes involves actual physical mechanisms in the brain, body, and environments; but, the shift also involves usage of metaphorical mechanisms. Metaphorical mechanisms may sound like an oxymoron, but they are very common in science. The general strategy is first to find a simple model system that is “like” a more complicated system under investigation; and then use the simple model as a “metaphor” to describe or generate insights about the more complicated system.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Donders’ Processing Stages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#donders-processing-stages"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Up to this chapter we have traced a line through psychology from Galton in 1865 to the period of behaviorism. There are several other starting points we could have chosen. For example, in the same year, 1865, Dutch Physiologist F. C. Donders presented behavioral experiments on human reaction times to support the beginnings of a mechanistic theory of cognitive operations.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-kosterPreface1969" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Koster, W. G. (1969). Preface. In W. G. Koster (Ed.), &lt;em&gt;Attention and &lt;span&gt;Performance II&lt;/span&gt;: Proceedings of the donders centenary symposium on reaction time&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span&gt;North-Holland Publishing Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>128</sup></a></span> I will characterize Donders work as using an assembly line metaphor of cognition. In an assembly line, raw material is sent from one stage of processing to another, and a product is formed at the end of the whole process. In cognition, sensory input is the raw material that is transformed in successive stages of processing. In an assembly-line, each stage of processing does a particular job, and takes an amount of time. Similarly, in cognition, Donders assumed that there were individual stages of processing (for different jobs of cognition), and that each job took some amount of time. He developed a method for identifying different stages of cognitive processing and estimating how long each of them took to complete. His was work was translated into English with the title, “On the speed of mental processes.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-dondersSpeedMentalProcesses1868" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Donders, F.

</h3>
<p>Donders was a physiologist and impressed with emerging work on the speed of nerve conduction. Earlier physiologists (Johannes Muller) said the velocity of nerve conduction could be infinitely fast, or unknowable. But, in 1849, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmolz</a>, succeeded in measuring nerve transmission speeds in a frog in the range of 24-36 metres per second.</p>
<p>The empirical observation that nerve conduction was not infinitely fast was very important for Donders. As a physiologist he assumed that thinking processes of the mind were controlled by organs in the brain. If the exchange of signals in the nervous occurred infinitely fast, he assumed that processes of thought might also occur infinitely fast. However, the discovery that nerves had physical properties limiting how fast they conducted signals suggested to Donders thoughts might have some measurable speed, so he set out record the speed thought.</p>

<p>First, Donders pointed to the concept of physiological reaction time, which came first from astronomy.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-canalesExitFrogEnter2001" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Canales, J.

Different observatories around the world would share records. Theories of planetary motion could be tested by comparing the predictions about where planets should be at different times, to the recorded data about where planets were observed to be at different times. There were discrepancies between theory and data. Astronomer Adolphe Hirsch wondered how much of the discrepancies were due to human error. Some of the human observers might have slightly faster perceptions than other human observers, and this could introduce error into the entries they made into the astronomical records. Hirsch set out to measure each observers “physiological” reaction time.</p>
<p>Imagine you are an astronomer about to look at star through a telescope. As soon as the light from the star hits your eyeball, how long will it take for you to be able to react to the light? Donders called this “physiological time” in reference to the time it would take for the light stimulus to be transduced through the eye into nervous activity that would eventually lead to a muscle. Hirsch had already developed methods to precisely measure an individuals “physiological reaction time,” and used those measures to correct the astronomical records from human error. Donders had a different usage for the method. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The idea occurred to me to interpose into the process of the physiological time some new components of mental action. If I investigated how much this would lengthen the physiological time, the would, I judged reveal the time required for the interposed term.”</p>

<p>Donders conducted many human reaction time experiments using tactile, visual and auditory stimuli. All of the experiments used a similar method. A subject was presented with a stimulus, and they responded to the stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible. Donders measured reaction times, which was defined as the amount of time between the onset of the stimulus and a subsequent response. Note, reaction times continue to be used in cognitive psychology, and their definition remains the same.</p>
<p>A basic question was whether different sense organs had different physiological reaction times. But, Donders was more interested in the additional “mental” time it might take to perform increasingly complex tasks before making a response to the stimuli. The tasks that Donders used to increase complexity are still widely used. In the remaining description of Donders work, I will use the modern terms for the tasks, and present a generic summary of Donders findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>The most basic reaction time task is called a <em>simple reaction time task</em>. In this task, subjects are presented with a stimulus, and asked to respond to as quickly as possible, as soon as they detect it. Donders would consider the reaction times from this task as “physiological reaction times.”</p>
<p>Donders invented the idea of having subjects perform a slightly more complicated task that is now referred to as the <em>GO-NO GO</em> task. In this task, subjects are presented with a stimulus, but they only make a response if the stimulus is the target stimulus. For example, one might see a red or green stimulus, and the response would be required only if the stimulus was green (a GO response). No response would be required if the stimulus was red (a NO GO trial).</p>
<p>An even more complicated version of the task is referred to as an <em>alternative forced-choice task</em>. For example, a subject could be asked to respond two a red stimulus by pressing a left button, and to respond to a green stimulus by pressing a right button. This would be called a 2-AFC (two-alternative forced choice) task.</p>

</h3>
<p>Donders used subtraction of reaction times between tasks to estimate the speed of mental operations. He assumed that mental operations occurred in successive stages like an assembly line, and that each stage took an average amount time. The fastest reaction time should be the physiological time given by the simple reaction time task. This one involved a minumum of mental processing. Reaction times should increase in length if mental processing had to occur before a response was made. For example, the GO-NO GO task should produce a longer reaction time than the simple reaction time task. This is because the task requires an additional mental operation of stimulus identification. In the GO-NO GO task, the stimulus must be identified as the target stimulus before a response is made.</p>
<p>If it took 170 milliseconds to make a response in the GO - NO GO task, and 150 milliseconds to make a response in the simple reaction time task, Donders took the difference of 20 milliseconds (by subtraction 170-150 = 20) to indicate the time taken by the mental operation. In this example, Donders might say the mental process of identification takes 20 milliseconds.</p>
<p>The subtraction logic could be applied to infer the times associated with subsequent stages of processing. For example, reaction times in a two alternative forced choice task (2AFC) are longer than in a GO-NO GO task. Following Donders logic, a 2AFC task involves yet another mental operation, response selection. For example, in this task the stimulus must be identified before a response is made, and then the correct response (e.g., right or left) must be selected before the final response is made. The stage of stimulus identification is assumed to occur before the subsequent stage of response selection. But, by subtracting the reaction time in the 2AFC task, from the reaction time in the GO-NO GO task, Donders argued that the amount of time for response selection could be separated from the amount of time for stimulus identification.</p>

<!-- influence on psychology -->
<p>It has been <span class="math inline">\(2021 - 1865 = 156\)</span> years since Donders proposed subtraction logic to measure stages of mental processing time. In 1969, following an Attention and Performance conference celebrating the centenary of Donders work, Saul Sternberg remarked that Donders subtractive method had been popular for decades, fell out of favor around the turn of the century, and that interest in the idea of processing stages was revived again in the 1960s. Sternberg himself was interested in the method and extended it in his <em>additive-factors logic</em> as another way to identify putative stages of mental operations. The concept of stages of processes has continued to be used since the 1960s, and we will revisit the general concept of processing stages throughout, especially in the chapter on attention.</p>
<p>Donders subtractive logic has also been widely used in neuro-imaging studies.</p>
<p>discovery of processing stages…or discovery of a question about what happens over time?</p>
<p>something was happening in the stage..it could potentially be named..and timed..a starting point for further clarification</p>

<!-- general issues with the metaphor 

- appeals to mechanism
- assembly lines do things in order, and each stage takes time...the subtractive logic does apply to orderly assembly lines
- what if cognition is not so orderly?
- Does the interpretation of what a task might logically involve force a conclusion that about stages of processing? Do stages of processing actually exist, or are they convenient metaphors?
