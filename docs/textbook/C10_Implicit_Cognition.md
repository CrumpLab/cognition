## This or That Psychology

A guiding theme for this chapter is the concept of a dichotomy. Dichotomies are a very common research strategy (for better or worse) throughout all of psychology, including cognition, and they are most definitely used in memory research. A dichotomy is a binary variable that divides something into two sides: this or that. In psychology, dichotomous variables are often used to describe properties of psychological phenomena. For example, here are a few binary oppositions common in cognition:

1. Conscious vs. Unconscious
2. Single system vs. multiple system
3. Serial vs. Parallel
4. Automatic vs. controlled
5. Explicit vs. implicit

Let's try applying these dichotomies to describe a psychological phenomena like the recency effect. For example, according to the multi-store model, the recency effect is a "conscious" phenomena. It is also a "multiple system" phenomena because people make the "controlled" and "explicit" decision to "serially" rehearse words in the short-term memory buffer. The use of dichotomies adds descriptive flavor to a psychological phenomena. At the same time, the terms don't always uniformly fit. For example, the long-term recency effect by Tzang isn't described very well by the same terms. In that case, people were using conscious, controlled, and explicit processes to count backwards in 3s while receiving words in the encoding phase. Nevertheless, a long-term recency effect was observed. Perhaps there is a "single" memory system that "automatically" causes the long-term recency effect by "unconsciously" or "implicitly" biasing how people perform the free recall task.

In memory research, researchers commonly propose different sorts of dichotomies about the processes involved in memory phenomenon. Experiments are sometimes constructed to test dichotomous claims in attempt to determine whether a phenomena is "this kind of thing" or "that kind of thing". This research strategy was famously criticized by Alan Newell in the 1970s [], who suggested that "playing 20 questions with nature" that would inevitably fail as a research strategy in cognition. And, we will return to Newell's critcism after becoming more familiar and comfortable with the use of dichotomies in cognitive research. In the next section we will continue our discussion of multiple-system approaches to memory, where dichotomies are commonly used to distinguish between different kinds of systems. For example, in the multi-store model, the short-term system is *capacity-limited*, but the long-term system is not. The sensory register *automatically* represents new information from sensory channels, but the short-term store requires a *controlled* decision by the subject to enter representations into the rehearsal loop.
