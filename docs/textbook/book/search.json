    "section": "",
    "text": "5.0.1 What is mental imagery?\nMental imagery is about the subjective experience of being in your own mind, especially while you are in the process of using your imagination. What can you see in your “mind’s eye” when you use your imagination? Can you visualize a picture, scene, or movie in your mind? If so, how would you describe the quality of the mental image? Is it vivid and life-like? If not, how would you describe your experience of using your imagination?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental imagery\n\n\n\nImagined sensations of any type, including seeing pictures in your mind’s eye, hearing a song in your head, using your inner voice, and others like imagined smell, touch, or sense of space.\n\n\nWhen I close my eyes I have some limited visualization ability. I can imagine visual scenes, especially familiar places like my kitchen. My imagery seems to be more spatial than visual. I can feel the layout of the scene more easily than seeing visual features of the mental picture. Occasionally my mental imagery is vivid and life-like, especially in dreams that can appear just as visually compelling as real life. So, according to me, my mental imagery ranges from fairly fuzzy to occasionally extremely vivid and life-like.\nThe next section reviews evidence that people report a wide range of mental imagery abilities. For example, some people report the ability to effortlessly visualize extremely clear and vivid life-like images. Some people report medium visualizing ability; and, other people report having very little to no mental imagery.\n\n\n5.0.2 Generating facts about mental imagery\nAnswering questions about mental imagery requires establishing facts about the phenomena that we can trust and collectively agree upon. However, the subjective aspects of mental imagery present difficulties for objectively measurement. Nevertheless, the literature contains methods and findings relevant to mental imagery phenomena, and because of the subjective nature of the topic some skepticism is required for evaluating the results of the research. We begin with the method of introspection.\n\n5.0.2.1 Methods of Introspection and Subjective report\nThe method of introspection involves self-reflecting upon or scrutinizing aspects of your own cognition. For example, I used introspection to think about my own mental imagery experience in the previous section. Similarly, I used the method of subjective report to describe my experiences using a short paragraph. As a historical sidenote, introspection was used as a technique to generate knowledge about the mind by early German psychologist Wilhem Wundt (1832-1920) and American psychologist Edward Titchener (1867-1927) who developed the structuralism school of psychology. Methods of subjective report remain very common today, often in the form of questionnaires that ask people to make various subjective judgments. Before considering the limitations of introspection and subjective report, let’s see a concrete example from the beginning of mental imagery research.\n\n\n5.0.2.2 Galton’s Statistics of mental imagery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)\n\n\n\nSir Francis Galton (1822-1911) was a British psychologist who was one of the first to systematically study mental imagery. To quote from his 1880 paper titled, Statistics of mental imagery (Galton, 1880), Galton set out to:\n\n“define the different degrees of vividness with which different persons have the faculty of recalling familiar scenes under the form of mental pictures, and the peculiarities of the mental visions of different persons” .\n\nThe next section reviews Galton’s methods and major findings. His original manuscript is freely available from archive.org.\n\n5.0.2.2.1 Galton’s Method of Subjective Report\nGalton devised the “Breakfast table task” involving a series of structured questions about mental imagery, and sent letters to 100 people asking them to reply with answers to his questions. The questions are reprinted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGalton’s Breakfast table task questions:\n\n\n\n“Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the opposite page, think of some definite object – suppose it is your breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning – and consider carefully the picture that rises before your mind’s eye. [p. 302]\n\nIllumination. – Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its brightness comparable to that of the actual scene ?\nDefinition. – Are all the objects pretty well defined at the same time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment more contracted than it is in a real scene?\nColouring. – Are the colours of the china, of the toast, bread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table, quite distinct and natural?”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2.2.2 Galton’s results\nHere are some of the answers from “100 men, at least half of whom are distinguished in science or in other fields of intellectual work.” (reprinted from his original manuscript):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is very high\n\n\n\n\nBrilliant, distinct, never blotchy.\nQuite comparable to the real object. I feel as though I was dazzled, e.g., when recalling the sun to my mental vision.\nIn some instances quite as bright as an actual scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is mediocre\n\n\n\n\nFairly clear and not incomparable in illumination with that of the real scene, especially when I first catch it. Apt to become fainter when more particularly attended to.\nFairly clear, not quite comparable to that of the actual scene. Some objects are more sharply defined than others, the more familiar objects coming more distinctly in my mind.\nFairly clear as a general image; details rather misty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is at the lowest\n\n\n\n\nDim and indistinct, yet I can give an account of this morning’s breakfast table; – split herrings, broiled chickens, bacon, rolls, rather light coloured marmalade, faint green plates with stiff pink flowers, the girls’ dresses, &c., &c. I can also tell where all the dishes were, and where the people sat (I was on a visit). But my imagination is seldom pictorial except between sleeping and waking, when I sometimes see rather vivid forms.\nI am very rarely able to recall any object whatever with any sort of distinctness. Very occasionally an object or image will recall itself, but even then it is more like a generalised image than an individual image. I seem to be almost destitute of visualising power, as under control.\nMy powers are zero. To my consciousness there is almost no association of memory with objective visual impressions. I recollect the breakfast table, but do not see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2.2.3 Galton’s conclusion\nGalton’s major conclusion and potential discovery was evidence for a wide variety of individual differences in mental imagery. Some people reported having very strong powers of mental visualization, some people reported having medium abilities, and other people reported having no abilities to visualize anything in their mind’s eye at all.\nIf Galton’s results provide facts that we can trust, then the task of explaining mental imagery just got a little bit harder. For example, in addition to explaining how people mentally image things, we also need to explain how some people can do it very well and others can’t do it at all. This is a good example of the increasing complexity that comes along with the research cycle: asking questions uncovers more facts that raise new questions requiring additional explanation.\n\n\n5.0.2.2.4 Limitations with Galton’s method\nGalton’s methods were straightforward. He wanted to know how different people experienced mental imagery, so he asked them to think about it and tell him. Although introspection and subjective report were good starting points they also have shortcomings that could invalidate the results. Consider the following limitations. Galton’s participants could have lied about their mental imagery. Their statements could reflect fictional stories rather than facts about mental imagery abilities. The participants may have inaccurately described their own experiences. For example, descriptions could be exaggerated or contain mistaken impressions. People may use different words that suggest larger differences in mental imagery than actually exist.\nEstablishing facts about mental imagery is difficult because a person’s subjective experience of their own mental imagery is not directly observable by other people. In other domains of inquiry, direct observation can help people quickly establish a set of agreed upon facts. For example, a group of geologists can all look and point at a rock formation, and agree that the rock formation is there, and then proceed to further inspect and measure the rock formation to gather more directly observable facts about it. Galton’s method of subjective report does have some directly observable measurements, such as the words that people used to describe their mental imagery; but, people’s verbal statements are an indirect attempt to communicate an experience, and do not provide an objective lens for other observers to directly view the experience itself.\nObtaining objective facts about subjective experience is undoubtedly a challenge, but there are tools developed since Galton to help make progress on the issues. One common requirement for establishing facts is to show that they are reproducible. In psychological research a reproducible finding is one that reliably occurs when an exact or conceptually similar study is repeated by other researchers. The next section examines the reproducibility of Galton’s core claims and findings.\n\n\n\n5.0.2.3 Reproducing Galton’s mental imagery work\nGalton conducted his work in the United Kingdom throughout the last half of the 1800s and like some of his other ideas (that we will discuss in the next chapter) they spread among psychologists in other countries. At the turn of the century, American psychologists were busy using Galton’s methods and publishing on the mental imagery abilities of college students. For example, in 1896, Armstrong (Armstrong Jr, 1894) gave the Breakfast table task to students at Wesleyan University (a male college). The general pattern of results was similar to what Galton found. The students reported a wide range of mental imagery abilities, including a small proportion of students who were classified as having little to no visual imagery.\nIn 1902, French (French, 1902) asked students at Vassar college (a female college) about their mental imagery abilities with a longer mental imagery questionnaire (by Titchener (Titchener, 1905)), that was intended to improve upon Galton’s original questions. The results were mostly consistent with prior results, and the Vassar students reported a wide range of different mental imagery abilities. But, one finding was not reproduced. All of the 118 students reported at least some mental imagery abilities, and none of them reported that they had zero mental imagery abilities. This could mean all of the students happened to have mental imagery abilities, or it could call into question the claims that some people do not have mental imagery. One possibility is that the results depend on the questionnaire. Galton had 10 questions about mental imagery, Titchener had almost 90 questions that covered imagery for more senses, and potentially gave students more opportunities to claim that they had at least some mental imagery. Perhaps, Galton and Armstrong would have found all of their participants reporting at least a little bit of mental imagery if they had used the newer questionnaire by Titchener.\n\n\n5.0.2.4 Aphantasia and Hyperphantasia\nLet’s skip over a century and ask what recent research on mental imagery looks like. In 2010, Zeman and colleagues reported a case of a patient with “imagery generation disorder” (A. Z. Zeman et al., 2010) that got picked up in the media. Several people who heard about the finding contacted the researchers to let them know that they also did not experience visual imagery. This led the research group to begin examining these claims in more detail and in 2015 (A. Zeman et al., 2015) they did something very similar to what Galton did; namely, ask people questions about the vividness of their mental imagery. They used a newer questionnaire developed to assess the vividness of visual imagery (Marks, 1973); and gave it to the people who claimed they had no visual imagery. Perhaps not surprisingly, those same people gave answers to the questionnaire that were consistent with their claims that they had visual imagery. Zeman coined the term (aphantasia)[#gls-aphantasia] to describe the condition of having little to no mental imagery.\nThe media attention to Zeman’s work on aphantasia caused a great of deal of interest across the world. One of the research participants 2015 study created the Aphantasia Network website, which has grown into a large online community for people with aphantasia. By 2020 (A. Zeman et al., 2020), Zeman’s group had been contacted by 14,000 people who either claimed they had aphantasia, or the opposite – extremely vivid and life-like mental imagery, termed hyperphantasia. Some of the claims are really quite extraordinary. For example, in a 2021 New York Times article (Zimmer, 2021), cognitive neuroscientist Joel Pearson claimed that ‘hyperphantasia could go far beyond just having an active imagination…and that “People [with hyperphantasia] watch a movie, and then they can watch it again in their mind, and it’s indistinguishable.”’.\nI can’t accurately replay a whole movie in my head. That is pretty incredible. To me, this claim is so incredible that I wonder if the person was exaggerating their ability a little bit. Although I am skeptical, there is no shortage of people accomplishing astounding, and objectively verifiable feats of cognition. Daniel Tammet (“Daniel Tammet,” 2021) is famous for breaking the European record for correctly reciting from memory, the first 22,514 digits of the number pi. So, if Daniel Tammet can accurately “replay” the digits of pi for five hours, maybe someone else can replay a whole movie in their mind. Again, the role of direct observation comes into play for lending support to an extraordinary claim. The fact that Daniel could say the digits of pi out loud for other observers to hear, under controlled conditions (where those observers could verify he wasn’t cheating somehow), makes it easier to believe that Daniel’s ability is real. Similarly, if there were more direct methods to test claims about extreme differences in mental imagery abilities, this would lend more support to those extraordinary claims.\n\n\n5.0.2.5 Taking stock of the facts so far\nWe have just surveyed a few examples of research into mental imagery abilities. These examples were chosen to highlight some of the challenges with establishing facts about cognitive abilities. I deliberately chose a tough example like mental imagery where it is inherently difficult to obtain clear, objective facts, that everyone can agree upon. So, before we consider an example of theorizing about mental imagery, and the larger task of explaining how an ability like mental imagery works; let’s consider the kinds of facts that we have so far, and the role that they play in the research cycle.\nI consider the work we reviewed so far as preliminary exploratory research that has been on a fact-finding mission. From Galton to Zeman, the questionnaires have been developed to ask “what” questions, rather than “how” questions. And, it is of course useful to establish facts about “what mental imagery is like”, before developing and testing theories about “how mental imagery works”.\nWhat facts about mental imagery can we say have been established by the research? First, reasonable people can have different answers to this question, which adds to the complexity of trying to explain cognitive abilities like mental imagery. To give my perspective, I’ll list a few questions about mental imagery facts, and discuss what kind of evidence we have for the facts.\nIs mental imagery a real cognitive ability? Are there individual differences in mental imagery abilities? Do some people really have zero mental imagery abilities? Do some people have truly life-like mental imagery?\nThe research we reviewed all used introspection and subjective report methods (questionnaires) to ask people questions about their own subjective experience of mental imagery. These methods have limitations as we discussed previously: people might be lying, inaccurate, inattentive, unable to describe their own experience, or describe similar experiences differently. As a consequence, the quality of the results is limited by the quality of the measurement tool. I would not claim that the questionnaire data provides clear, objective facts about a person’s internal subjective experience of mental imagery. At the same time, I would agree that the research has produced some objective facts about how people describe their own mental imagery. Across centuries, and thousands of participants, people consistently claim that mental imagery is real for them, and similar proportions of people consistently claim that they have extremely different kinds of mental imagery abilities. So, if you were to make your own questionnaire to ask random people on the street about their mental imagery abilities, what do you think would happen given the existing research we discussed? My prediction would be that you would find the same kinds of results that Galton did in 1880, and Zeman did in the 2010s.\nSome of the big takeaways for me from reviewing this slice of the literature are the following. First, asking people about their own experience is a useful thing to do, especially when you want to learn something about their subjective experience. People make consistent claims about mental imagery, and provide preliminary forms of subjective evidence about features of their own mental imagery. There are limitations due to subjective report, and it would be useful to develop alternative tools to measure different aspects of mental imagery in a more objective way.\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Theories, explanation and mental imagery\nThe cognitive sciences is not only concerned with discovering the facts about cognitive abilities like mental imagery, it is also interested in explaining how the abilities work. Explanations can take different forms, and across the textbook we will encounter relatively simple claims about how something might work, to well-developed verbal theories, to highly specified computer simulations that propose working algorithms for specific cognitive abilities. And, throughout, I will encourage us to keep wondering about what kind of explanation would be satisfying to you, to explain how different cognitive abilities work.\nI think I can safely say that as of right now, there is no broadly accepted theory or explanation about how mental imagery works. As we already discussed, there isn’t really great consensus on the features of mental imagery itself, so the absence of a theory isn’t too surprising. However, there has been a great deal of theoretical debate about mental imagery, and this debate provides a really nice example to discuss how theories and explanations are used in cognitive research.\n\n5.0.3.1 Mental Imagery as explanation\nIn the previous section, I mentioned that we skipped about a hundred years of research. And there were some general trends in psychology that shaped how researchers asked questions about mental imagery. Some of the general trends correspond to gradual transitions between “schools” of thought in psychology. At the beginning of psychology in the USA, Titchener (1867-1927) developed the “Structuralist” school of thought, and used careful, but subjective, introspection techniques to interrogate and discover individual components of cognition. Behaviorism was another school of thought that favored asking questions that could only be answered with objective measures of behavior. Some “hard-core” behaviorists like B.F. Skinner (1904-1990), claimed that internal processes of the mind were simply outside the boundaries of scientific inquiry, and that psychology should only study observable phenomena like behavior. So, whole topics like mental imagery received less attention by researchers. However, in the 1950s 60s, and 70s, there was a “cognitive revolution” of sorts, and more psychologists returned to asking questions about cognitive abilities, including mental imagery.\nWhen mental imagery returned as a research topic it also came back as a potential explanation of other cognitive abilities. For example, by the 1960s there was already a very large literature on human memory abilities, which was often focused on examining factors that influence how well people can remember verbal stimuli like words. In 1963, Allan Paivio (Paivio, 1963) considered the possibility that mental imagery might be involved in tasks where people attempt to remember words from a list. He suggested that experiencing strong mental imagery when reading a word could make it easier to remember that word later on. Similarly, other words might not be associated with strong mental imagery, and those kinds of words might be harder to remember later on. Paivio also provided some experimental evidence that was consistent with the idea that mental imagery is involved in memory abilities.\n\n\n5.0.3.2 Paivio’s concrete versus abstract memory task\nPaivio used a standard paired-associate learning task. He ran experiments on elementary school students, and on college students, and found similar results. Here’s what happened if you were a subject in the experiment.\nEveryone was given pairs of words to remember for a later memory test. Each pair involved an adjective and a noun, like “Ingenious-Inventor”. Importantly, there were two different kinds of word-pairs, and this was the critical manipulation in the experiment. The manipulation was whether the noun was more concrete or more abstract. Examples of the two kinds of word pairs are presented below:\n\n\n\nConcrete pairs\nAbstract Pairs\n\n\n\n\nIngenious-Inventor\nIngenious-Interpretation\n\n\nTechnical-Advertisement\nTechnical-Discourse\n\n\nMassive-Granite\nMassive-Rebellion\n\n\nSubtle-Magician\nSubtle-Prejudice\n\n\nProfound-Philosopher\nProfound-Analysis\n\n\nRugged-Arctic\nRugged-Locality\n\n\nShabby-Hermit\nShabby-Client\n\n\nClumsy-Burglar\nClumsy-Imitation\n\n\nUnpleasant-Bruise\nUnpleasant-Scandal\n\n\nSensitive-Lungs\nSensitive-Tissue\n\n\nColourful-Maple\nColourful-Scenery\n\n\nReliable-Luggage\nReliable-Merchandize\n\n\nExpressive-Actress\nExpressive-Temperament\n\n\nAmazing-Circus\nAmazing-Crusade\n\n\nNoisy-Trumpet\nNoisy-Gossip\n\n\nFashionable-Overcoat\nFashionable-Apparel\n\n\n\nWhat makes a noun more concrete or abstract? I think this remains a good question, and the distinction isn’t always so clear to me. The general idea was that concrete words are potentially more evocative, meaningful, and easier to mentally image than abstract words. For example, hearing or reading the word “Magician” might cause you to think of a colorful magician’s hat, whereas the word “Discourse” might not bring to mind specific mental images. Paivio chose the words that he considered more concrete and more abstract when constructing the lists for his experiment.\nDuring the encoding phase, the experimenter read lists of 16 word pairs out loud, with a two second pause in between. Half of the word pairs had a concrete noun, and the other half had an abstract noun. During the memory test, the experimenter read out only the first word from each pair (the adjective), and participants were asked to remember the word it was paired with and write it down. If you heard the word Amazing and you were given the concrete pair, then the correct answer would be to write down Circus. If you were given the abstract pair, then the correct answer would be Crusade.\nThe empirical question was whether people would have better memory for the concrete nouns compared to the abstract nouns, and this is exactly what Paivio found. In the second experiment, he found that people remembered on average about 4.5 words correctly if they were concrete nouns, but only about 2 words correctly if they were abstract nouns. This is only a difference of 2.5 words, but the result seemed to be consistent across 120 university students, and it suggested that something about the concrete versus abstract quality of these words caused differences in memory performance for the words.\n\n5.0.3.2.1 Paivio’s explanations\nPaivio entertained different explanations of his results, and the way he related results to explanations is fairly common in cognitive psychology. In the introduction of his paper he referred to new ideas about how memory might work from Miller, Galanter, & Pribram (Miller et al., 1960), who suggested that mental imagery could help people efficiently organize, store, and then later retrieve information in memory. And, he raised the possibility that mental imagery was the reason why participants remembered concrete (more image-able) better than abstract nouns (less image-able). Let’s call this the mental imagery explanation.\nHowever, Paivio actually concluded that the “concept of mediating imagery…may be unnecessary” to explain his results. Instead, de described another possibility that memory performance was being determined by pre-existing associations between the word pairs. For example, some words are more likely to follow other words, and people may have different learned associations between different words. For example, it’s possible that I have a stronger learned association between “Noisy-Trumpet” (which was a concrete pair) than “Noisy-Gossip” (which was an abstract pair). If I was in this experiment and was given the cue word “Noisy”, I might be better able to remember “Trumpet” not because I formed an mental of image of a “Trumpet”, but because “Noisy” was already more strongly associated with “Trumpet” in the first place. Let’s call this the pre-existing association explanation.\n\n\n5.0.3.2.2 The research cycle and theory testing\nMore interestingly, Paivio ended his paper with a proposal for another experiment that could put these two explanations to the test. This is an instructive example of how the research cycle is used in cognition to refine questions from one experiment to another. A key ingredient is having at least two tentative explanations of the experimental results that make different testable predictions. Paivio’s were the mental imagery explanation and the pre-existing association explanation. The next ingredient is researcher creativity to come up with a new experiment that is capable of putting the predictions to the test.\nFor example, imagine that there was a drug that immediately turned off everyone’s mental imagery. If mental imagery is responsible for people remembering concrete nouns better than abstract nouns, and if we repeated the experiment but gave people the drug to turn off their mental imagery, then what should happen to memory for the words? According to the mental imagery explanation, the difference in memory performance between concrete and abstract words should disappear. This is because mental imagery would be “turned off”, and would not be able to cause any differences in memory between the words. If there were still differences in memory between the words, this would be good evidence against the mental imagery explanation.\nPaivio didn’t have a magic wand to make mental imagery turn off, so he suggested a different approach, to control for aspects of the pre-existing association explanation. He proposed a new experiment could be repeated with random pairings between adjectives and concrete versus abstract nouns. For example, Noisy-Trumpet isn’t very random because the adjective noisy happens to be meaningful for some trumpets, and there could easily be pre-existing associations between Noisy and Trumpet. However, the influence of pre-existing associations could potentially be eliminated by randomly assigning unrelated adjectives to the nouns. If the advantage for remembering concrete over abstract nouns persisted under these new control conditions, then Paivio would have evidence that pre-existing associations do not explain his findings. And, perhaps the concept of “mediating imagery” would be necessary to explain these influences on memory for words.\n\n\n\n5.0.3.3 Theories of Mental Representation\nBefore evaluating the kinds of explanations of cognitive abilities we have seen so far, let’s do one more example from the literature. Throughout the 60s and 70s, there were many other studies like Paivio’s that invoked the concept of mental imagery as potentially necessary to explain how people were performing different kinds of tasks. In 1973, Zenon Pylyshyn (Pylyshyn, 1973) published a critique of the emerging mental imagery explanations, and initiated a lengthy debate with Stephen Kosslyn about the form of mental representations. This debate led to a number of experiments attempting to provide evidence in favor and/or against either position.\nI will use the terms pictorial versus propositional to distinguish between the two theoretical ideas about mental representations. The pictorial representation idea is that perceptual experiences and mental imagery experiences are represented in somewhat similar formats. This could imply that perception is involved somehow in mental imagery, and that mental imagery might behave similarly to perception in some circumstances. The term “pictorial representation” is meant to evoke the really simple idea that perceiving and imagining an image might rely on closely related mental representations.\nAlternatively, the propositional representation assumption is that mental representations are really fundamentally different from our perceptual experiences. A propositional system uses symbols and rules for their combination and recombination to describe mental representations. We’ll see a more concrete example shortly, but propositional systems aren’t too different from using words to describe an image. A paragraph of words to describe an image involves word symbols and rules for putting words together in order. A well-written paragraph can do an OK job of representing a visual scene. And, it is hopefully clear enough that using words to describe an image involves a totally different kind of representation, than say taking a picture of the image. On this view, people don’t actually have pictures in their mind, instead cognitive abilities are controlled by propositional knowledge and representation systems.\nThe pictorial and propositional ideas about cognitive representation are two very different takes on the fabric of cognition. Is our cognition running on picture-like or perception-like representations of our experiences with the world? Or, is our cognition running on totally abstract propositional codes that are qualitatively different from perception? Do these alternative ideas about mental representation make different predictions? If so, can the predictions be tested with experiments? To answer these questions, let’s look at an experiment using the mental chronometry technique.\n\n5.0.3.3.1 Mental Chronometry\nIn 1978, Stephen Kosslyn and colleagues (Kosslyn et al., 1978) did some clever experiments on scanning of mental images. Here’s the quick and dirty version. Imagine a map of the USA, now zoom in on New York City and imagine a little black dot hovering over the city. Whenever you are ready, zoom that little black dot all the way over to Los Angeles. How long it did it take you to mentally scan across your mental image of the map? Mental chronometry refers to measuring how long it takes to perform mental operations like scanning a mental image.\nInstead of a map of the USA, participants were shown the map in Figure fig-2Kosslyn and given practice mentally imaging the map and drawing it from memory until they could reproduce it to a high degree of accuracy. The map shows an island with a hut, tree, rock, well, lake, sand, and grass, all spread about the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Kosslyn’s participants used cartoon maps like this in his mental scanning experiments.\n\n\n\nThe map was taken away and participants were asked to mentally image the map in their mind’s eye. Then, the main task began. The task was split up into individual trials where the participant was asked to focus on one of the depicted locations on their mental image of the map (by imagining a black dot on top of it), and then mentally scan to a different location by moving their imagined black dot to the new location. For example, you might focus on the tree and the scan to the grass (a longer distance); or focus on the hut and scan to the lake (a shorter distance). Importantly, the researchers measured the time taken to make each scan. The empirical question was whether or not the amount of time to mentally scan from one imagined location to another would depend on the distance between the imagined locations.\nBefore we look at the actual data, let’s consider three ways the experiment could have turned out. First, let’s assume that people can scan between different locations immediately without taking any time at all, I will call this the “no-time” hypothesis. Second, let’s assume that people will take some random amount of time to scan between the locations, the “random-time” hypothesis. And third, let’s assume that people’s scanning times will increase with the distance between the imagined locations, the “distance-time” hypothesis. Each of the these hypotheses makes a different prediction about how the results might turn out. Consider the three graphs in Figure fig-2predictScanning showing predictions for each hypothesis. These are examples of how the results could have turned out according to each hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Hypothetical results of the mental scanning task for the no-time, random-time, and distance-time hypotheses\n\n\n\n\nEach of the panels shows a scatter plot of possible results. The y-axis (vertical axis) represents amount of time in seconds and ranges from zero to two seconds. Dots that are near the bottom of the plot represent shorter scanning times, and dots closer to the top represent longer scanning times. The x-axis (horizontal axis) represents the distance between locations in centimeters on the real map that participants saw before they had to imagine it. Dots closer to the left of a plot represent scanning times between locations that were close together, and dots closer to the right side represent scanning times between locations that were far apart.\nThe “no-time” plot shows all of the dots in a line at the bottom, which represents 0 seconds. This is what would happen if people could instantaneously scan from any location to any other location. Even though some locations would be closer together or further apart (represented by the fact that there are dots that go all the way from 1 cm to 15 cm), all of the scanning times would be 0.\nThe “random-time” plot shows dots spread about randomly. When I drew this graph, I had my computer pick random numbers. This is what would happen if people do take different amounts of time to scan between locations, but the amount of time would be unpredictable, and it would not depend on the distance between the imagined locations. People might be fast or slow to scan between locations that were close or far apart, and scanning speed could fluctuate based on other factors like how motivated or sleepy people were.\nFinally, the “distance-time” plot shows dots in a tilted line (going from the bottom left to the top right) showing a positive relationship or correlation between distance and time. This is what could happen if the distance between imagined locations influences scanning time in a systematic way. Specifically, this graph shows a linear relationship. As the distance between locations increases, so does scanning time. Shorter distances take less time, and longer distances take more time.\nWhat were the results of the study, and did they look like any of the hypothetical results that we just discussed? The original results are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: A screenshot of Kosslyn’s results.\n\n\n\n\nThe dots represent average scanning times between specific locations for all of the participants, and they mostly fall on the straight line. To me, the results look most like the hypothetical “distance-time” results. The data points are a little bit noisy, and they don’t fall precisely on the line every time, so there is a bit of randomness or variability in mental scanning time too. But overall, people appear to take longer to scan between imagined locations on the map as the distance between the locations increases.\nBefore considering what these results could mean for theories of mental representation, let’s note that this study made an attempt at advancing how mental imagery could be investigated using more objective behavioral measures. In this case, the measurement of time to make a mental scan was directly observable. Although directly observable measures of behavior have many desirable properties, including the possibility that multiple observers can mutually confirm and reach consensus on what they are observing, there are also big limitations when it comes to cognition. The biggest limitation is that direct measures of behavior are not direct measures of cognitive processes. The assumption is that cognitive processes are involved in producing the behavior in question, and that measures of behavior therefore indirectly reflect the underlying mechanisms of the mind causing the behavior. So, when someone measures “mental scanning time”, we are only measuring the time associated with whatever happened during “mental scanning”. The measure of time does not directly show whether or not a mental image is like a picture or a proposition. Instead, a common strategy in cognitive research is to theorize about how cognitive processes might work, and attempt to explain how those cognitive processes would result in the observable measures of behavior.\n\n\n\n5.0.3.4 Explaining mental scanning times\nLet’s assume that Kosslyn et al’s results can be trusted as a fact, and that when people scan a mental image it really does take longer to scan across longer than shorter distances in the mental image. What does this factoid tell us about the nature of mental representation? Perhaps a better question is, how are factoids like this one used in cognitive research to generate knowledge about cognitive processes?\nOne strategy involves inventing theories and hypotheses about cognition, and then evaluating whether or not they can predict, anticipate, and/or explain the patterns of measurements found by experiment. If a theory can explain a finding maybe it is correct. If a theory can not explain a finding, maybe it is wrong and should be discarded. Over time the process of theory building and testing would lead to a great many discarded theories that couldn’t explain the findings, and what would be left could be plausible working theories that do a pretty good job explaining the findings. This characterization of how the scientific method incrementally hones in on better explanations is connects with issues in the philosophy of science (e.g., Popper, 1959), which I will elaborate on over the book.\nLet’s finish this section by returning to the distinction between pictorial and propositional mental representations, and ask whether the pattern of data is consistent or inconsistent with either of those ideas.\n\n5.0.3.4.1 A pictorial explanation of scanning time\nAre the findings consistent with the assumption that people have picture-like mental representations of visual images? I don’t think this question can be answered without first speculating more about how pictorial representations might work, and how they could lead to the results reported by Kosslyn et al. Here’s a simple metaphorical elaboration. I could propose that mental imagery for visual images is like perception for visual scenes, and that because of this relationship, mental imagery should behave in similar ways to visual perception. For example, objects in visual scenes have spatial distances between them, and by analogy mental images of scenes should preserve the spatial distances between imaginary objects. When looking from one object to another in the real world, it can takes time to move your eyes, and the amount of time naturally depends on how far the eyes need to move. If the metaphor holds, it is possible that mentally scanning an image will behave in the same way. So, my answer is yes. The findings could be consistent with the pictorial mental representation assumption, but only if I created a story that established how this assumption would work.\n\n\n5.0.3.4.2 A propositional explanation of scanning time\nLet’s ask whether the results are consistent with the propositional assumption about mental representations. Pylyshyn argued that Kosslyn’s results could be explained without assuming any role for pictorial mental representations. Again, to consider the propositional assumption we need to embed it into a working hypothesis about how people use propositional knowledge. First, consider how propositions could be used to code relations between objects in the scene. I will use sentences as an example of combining abstract symbols (words) to represent relations between objects in the scene.\n\nThe island contains objects\nThe rock is on the north end of the island\nThe grass is on the north-west side of the island.\nThe grass is south-west of the rock\nThe tree is south of the grass, in the southwest of the island\nThe well is due west of the tree\nThe hut is just south of well\nThe lake is close to the tree, just to the southeast\n\nThe next step is to consider how people might rely on propositions during the mental scanning task. For example, maybe the time to mentally scan between one object and another actually reflects the time it takes to activate knowledge about different objects in the propositional network. Lake and tree are close in the image, but they are also coded together in the same proposition, which could make it easier to go from the lake concept to the tree concept. Similarly, the rock is far from the tree in the image, but the way I wrote the propositions, rock is not directly coded in relation to the tree, but that relation can be established by moving through multiple propositions: the tree is south of the grass, and the grass is south-west of the rock. It might take more time to scan longer distances in the mental image because of the requirement to process multiple propositions.\nAs an aside, given that we have learned about aphantasia (people with no mental imagery), I wonder how aphantasics would perform in Kosslyn’s task–if mental imagery is not required to perform the task, maybe they would be just fine and show the same results as everyone else…or maybe they would refuse to do the task because they would be unable to imagine the map.\n\n\n5.0.3.4.3 Evaluating the explanations\nNear the beginning of this chapter I suggested that the cognitive sciences are interested in explaining how cognition works. Throughout this book we will examine how the research process is used to construct explanations about how cognition works. There are different approaches to explanation, and some of the explanations will be more or less satisfying than others. I would like to briefly evaluate the kind of explanations that I just discussed to explain the mental scanning time results. For example, there are some ways in which I find the pictorial and propositional explanations satisfying and unsatisfying. And, talking about this a little bit should help us focus on useful features of the research process that push the cognitive sciences forward. However, I think a quick detour is necessary to prepare us with some basic concepts about theories and explanations, and how they can be tested.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.4 Society and Historical context\nOne outgrowth of the mental imagery research we discussed was the creation of the website aphantasia.com, where many people from across the world are creating an online community to discuss and learn more about their own extreme differences in mental imagery abilities. This is a great example of people being interested in how their own cognition works, and wanting learn to more about it. For me personally, I think it would be great if research into mental imagery could help me increase how much control I have over the vividness of my mental imagery. Maybe continued research on this topic will lead to discoveries on this issue. That could be a positive development for me and other people interested in controlling the vividness of their mental imagery.\nAs I mentioned before, research into cognitive abilities has not always had uniformly positive implications for society, and there are examples where research applications were severely destructive for some groups of people. For example, remember Sir Francis Galton? In 1880 he published the first study showing evidence for individual differences in mental imagery. Mental imagery is a fascinating topic about how people experience their own mental life. You might assume that Galton was interested in answering questions like, “how does mental imagery work?”. Perhaps this was part of Galton’s motivation for running the study. But, I have purposefully been silent so far about other reasons why Galton ran the study. He tells us the main reason at the beginning of his paper, which reads:\n“The larger object of my inquiry is to elicit facts that shall define the natural varieties of mental disposition in the two sexes and in different races, and afford trustworthy data as to the relative frequency with which different faculties are inherited in different degrees.”\nWhy do you think Galton was trying to measure if mental imagery is different between people? Was he trying to explain how mental imagery works?\nWhat was going on at the time that led Galton to ask his questions about mental imagery? How did his results and larger research program influence society? Unfortunately, I should warn you that if you do not already know the answers to these questions, you may find the history deeply disturbing, I know I did.\nI mentioned earlier that Galton was in the United Kingdom, and that some of his ideas tended to spread among psychologists in other countries. Galton is famous for many things because he happened to make contributions in many different fields. For example, he is involved with inventing the statistical concept of correlation (Galton, 1889; Stigler, 1989). He was interested in correlation because he was interested in inheritance, especially the idea that children inherit mental abilities from their parents (Galton, 1890). And, Galton was interested in the inheritance of mental abilities because he was also the father of the eugenics movement (Galton, 1865, 1869). Eugenics became a world-wide social movement partly interested in “improving” society across generations through selective human breeding programs. Eugenics programs, ideology, and social policies led to numerous historical injustices and violations of human rights and atrocities.\nAfter spending a great deal of time learning about the lasting legacy of eugenics in society, along with the fact that the discipline of psychology played a very large role facilitating the eugenics movement; I have decided that it would be irresponsible of me to write a survey textbook on cognitive research without acknowledging the historical background of eugenics. I review this background in the next chapter, and then connect it with psychological research into cognitive abilities in the upcoming chapter on intelligence testing, as well as a few other aspects of cognitive research throughout the textbook.\n\n\n5.0.5 Appendix\n\n5.0.5.1 Glossary\n\nAphantasia\nA term describing people who report experiencing very little to no mental imagery.\n\n\nHyperphantasia\nA term describing people who report experiencing extremely vivid and life-like mental imagery.\n\n\nIntrospection\nThe process of evaluating one’s own subjective experiences. For example, introspection could involve personally scrutinizing the quality and nature of mental experiences that occur while remembering a previous life event.\nIntrospection was developed as a psychological method by E. B. Titchener, and was criticized by proponents of behaviorism for being too subjective.\n\n\nMental Imagery\nThe subjective experience of imagined sensations of any type, including seeing pictures in your mind’s eye, hearing a song in your head, using your inner voice, and others like imagined smell, touch, or sense of space.\n\n\n\n5.0.5.2 References\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong Jr, A.

    "text": "Note: my training as a cognitive psychologist mostly skipped over the topic of mental testing, especially the history and development of intelligence tests. This is chapter is an ongoing attempt to organize some of that history and connect it with issues in cognition. I have found the history to be complex and often extremely fraught. Although mental testing is widespread and has many proponents and use cases; mental testing is also intertwined with the eugenics movement, and the practice of mental testing has negatively impacted marginalized groups. The scientific and social merits/pitfalls of intelligence testing have been continuously debated in domains where mental testing has been introduced.\n\n7.0.1 The intelligence test race\nThe Stanford-Binet test was among the first intelligence tests to be widely adopted and used in America. Alfred Binet (1857-1911) was a French psychologist who published the Binet-Simon test (with his student Theodore Simon) in 1905 (Binet & Simon, 1905b), which described revised intelligence tests Binet was working on for over a decade prior (Nicolas et al., 2014). Lewis Terman was an American psychologist at Stanford University, who helped popularize Binet’s test in America (Terman, 1916), hence Stanford-Binet. Also in 1916, Psychologist Henry Goddard published an English translation (by Elizabeth Kite) of five of Binet’s papers on intelligence testing in a book titled “The Development of Intelligence in Children” (Kite, 1916). The entire book is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the internet archive.\nIt is convenient to start with the Stanford-Binet test, because Terman and Binet represent somewhat dueling progressive notions (for the time) about how psychological science could and should be used to improve society. These dueling notions involve the nature/nurture debate about the heritability and fixed or flexible nature of mental abilities; and the implications of that debate for enacting social policy that follow from taking different sides of the debate.\nIn the early 1900s, countries were finding ways to respond to social issues (crime, education, mental healthcare) with social institutions and policies, and academics were discussing how science could make responses more efficient and less resource demanding. The eugenics movement, of which Terman was a strong proponent, billed itself as a progressive movement capable of fixing societies ailments. Social problems were explained by hereditary influences, solutions included measures that would prevent “defective” people from breeding. In the domain of mental health, people labelled “feeble-minded” were institutionalized and placed under care of the state. Building, maintaining, and staffing buildings took resources; but, from the perspective of eugenics, the investment was worth the cost because the institutions allowed “defective” people to be segregated from society. Segregating and institutionalizing people for crimes or mental health reasons was a widespread practice before the advent of mental tests. From Terman’s perspective (Terman, 1916), intelligence tests would have obvious benefits for negative and positive eugenics policies. For negative eugenics, mental testing would make institutionalization even more effective at segregating unwanted people from society. For example, in envisioning how testing could be applied to discover hidden “defective” schoolchildren he wrote, “it is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection of society. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency”. Furthermore, intelligence testing could also be used for positive eugenics, by identifying hidden geniuses and grooming them to become national leaders; Terman wrote, “The number of children with very superior ability is approximately as great as the number of feeble-minded. The future welfare of the country hinges, in no small degree, upon the right education of these superior children.”\nBinet did not presume that mental abilities were fixed or inherited, and he argued that presumptions about human intelligence were premature in the absence of rigorous tests providing objective evidence on the matter. Binet was also hired by the French government to address pressing issues in education. For example, without objective mental tests, French schoolchildren were already being divided up into “normal” children, sent to regular school, and “defective” children sent to special schools or otherwise institutionalized. Binet saw the existing methods for deciding the fate of children as deeply flawed, arbitrary, open to numerous forms of bias, and a drain government resources. One set of concerns involved child welfare. The lack of accurate testing meant that some normal children were accidentally being institutionalized for the wrong reasons. Relatedly, Binet speculated that education could improve mental abilities, even of “sub-normal” children. Another set of concerns involved efficiencies for society. Binet also considered that educational resources could be wasted on children not capable of learning. As a progressive, he also envisioned a high-functioning utopian society where science was able to accurately test every person for their aptitudes, and then assign people to tasks in society with utmost efficiency (Binet & Simon, 1908). But, those lofty ideas could not be accomplished without a scientifically accurate intelligence test.\nThe race to develop intelligence tests was more like a relay race. Researchers were vying to create intelligence tests that withstood scientific and public scrutiny. These tests would be handed off like batons to officials involved in decision-making at the level of social institutions and government. Researchers and practitioners took different sides on the nature/nurture debate and assumed mental abilities were inherited and fixed at birth, or flexibly acquired over development. These assumptions tinted interpretation of test results, and biased decision-making and implementation of social programs. For example, what should happen to children who are mentally inferior according to an intelligence test? A eugenicist and hereditarian might argue these children should be institutionalized and refused education, because they were genetically incapable of learning, would never contribute to society, and worse would further pollute the gene pool if they had children. Alternatively, psychologists like Binet were open to the possibility that mental abilities could be developed and acquired with experience, and that education systems could be improved to meet needs of children with low to high mental abilities. The next sections explore iterations of research that culminated in Binet’s intelligence test; followed by examples of how the tests were applied in the United States.\n\n7.0.1.1 Cattell’s mental tests\nWe already mentioned that Galton’s research on individual differences in the vividness of mental imagery from 1880, was an early attempt to measure mental abilities associated with intelligence. Galton’s work, including his eugenics ideas, inspired many psychologists to develop better mental tests. For example, James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944), published “Mental tests and Measurements” in 1890 (CATTELL, 1890). Cattell made numerous contributions to American psychology, and continues to be honored by the Association for Psychological Sciences (APS) through their “James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award” for lifetime achievement. Like Galton, Cattell was also a proponent of eugenics.\nHere is the first paragraph from Cattell’s paper:\n\n“Psychology cannot attain the certainty and exactness of the physical sciences, unless it rests on a foundation of experiment and measurement. A step in this direction could be made by applying a series of mental tests and measurements to a large number of individuals. The results would be of considerable scientific value in discovering the constancy of mental processes, their interdependence, and their variation under different circumstances. Individuals, besides, would find their tests interesting, and, perhaps, useful in regard to training, mode of life or indication of disease. The scientific and practical value of such tests would be much increased should a uniform system be adopted, so that determinations made at different times and places could be compared and combined.”With a view to obtaining agreement among those interested, I venture to suggest the following series of tests and measurements, together with methods of making them.”\n\nCattell was corresponding with Galton to make the tests, “meet with his approval”, but he only indirectly references the application of mental testing to the eugenics movement (e.g., “indication of disease”), and he mentions several other reasons to pursue the creation of mental tests. In a footnote, he mentions that, “the nationality (including that of the parents), and the age, sex, occupation and state of health” should all be recorded when participants take the test”. The inclusion of these measurements is consistent with eugenical aims to show that different races had inherited different mental abilities.\nCattell proposed to measure each person on ten tests:\n\nDynamometer Pressure, (to measure squeezing hand strength).\nRate of Movement (how fast you can move your hand).\nSensation-areas (telling apart two pin-pricks)\nPressure causing Pain\nLeast noticeable difference in Weight\nReaction-time for Sound\nTime for naming Colours\nBi-section of a 50 cm line\nJudgment of 10 seconds time\nNumber of Letters remembered on once Hearing\n\nYou might notice these individual tests range across physical and mental abilities, and none of them measure a complicated concept like human intelligence. At the end of the paper, Cattell lists 50 additional tests for sight (14 tests), Hearing (8 test), Taste and Smell (3 tests), Touch and Temperature (7 tests), Sense of Effort and Movement (4 tests), Mental Time (7 test), Mental intensity (2 tests), and Mental Extensity (5 tests), that he thought should be important for the incoming discipline of Experimental Psychology. Many of the tests became useful for theorizing about how individual psychological processes work.\nBy 1896, Cattell had moved from Pennsylvania to New York City, where he published measurements of Columbia university students (Cattell & Farrand, 1896). By today’s standards, Cattell’s test might raise privacy concerns about what he was planning to do with the data he collected. Cattell reported statistics on hair and eye color, height and weight, head-size, breathing capacity, color-blindness, vision, color preferences, hearing, pitch-perception, skin-sensation, hand-strength, reaction-time, perception of time and space, memory, and mental imagery. In addition, the examiner who administered the test made separate judgments of each student’s quality (physical goodness, good student, level of intellectual ability, strong-will etc.), based on their professional opinion. Finally, students were given a lengthy questionnaire to report on their family history, medical history, daily behaviors, and preferences (what’s your favorite novel, what gives you pleasure, etc.). Cattell concludes that science should proceed to determine the interrelations between his measurements, and establish how much knowing one thing about a person can predict something else about them. He also concludes that “we must use our measurements to study the development of the individual and of the race, to disentangle the complex factors of heredity and environment”, and that the most important thing that science can do is guide the development of man.\n\n\n7.0.1.2 Binet’s critiques\nSeveral other psychologists inspired by Galton were also publishing results from their own mental tests around this time, including Hugo Munsterberg (Munsterberg, 1891), J. Allen Gilbert (Gilbert, 1895), and Emil Kraepelin (Kraepelin, 1895). Alfred Binet was among the psychologists interested in mental testing, and well before he published his famous test, he critiqued the existing literature on mental testing in 1895 (Nicolas et al., 2014). Binet pointed out that tests were measuring physical ability (like grip strength) and basic sensory abilities; but, rarely measured what he considered higher mental abilities. Binet proposed that individual differences in higher mental abilities could be measured by simple tests, but only if the tests were mentally challenging. He proposed tests for Memory–drawing a geometric shape from memory, reproducing a sentence from memory, memory for musical notes, memory for a color, memory for 12 objects–tests for Mental Imagery; Imagination; Attention– duration of attention, size of attentional field, performing multiple tasks at once–tests for understanding–give a definition, criticize a sentence–tests for suggestibility; for Aesthetic feeling–what are a persons preferences, are they same as artists?–tests of Moral Feelings; muscular and will power; and motor skill and glance. As Binet might have predicted, Cattell’s initial mental testing program flopped. Cattell tried to demonstrate he could predict students’ grades in college from their scores on his mental test, but he wasn’t able to reliably reproduce the relationship. It seemed obvious that college grades should measure something about mental abilities. If Cattell was measuring mental abilities with his tests, then students with high scores should have high grades, and students with low scores should have low grades. Such a positive correlation would provide validity to Cattell’s mental ability tests. However, multiple attempts to show that test performance positively correlated with grades instead showed no consistent correlation. One interpretation was that Cattell’s tests were not measuring mental abilities like a person’s general intelligence.\n\n\n\n7.0.2 Binet-Simon Test (1905-1911)\nThis section describes the Binet-Simon test in more detail, including summaries of the five papers translated to English in 1916 (Kite, 1916). Many variations of mental tests have been created since the Binet-Simon test, but it still serves as a useful example of an “intelligence” test. I quoted “intelligence” because we can reserve judgment on what the test measures until after we look at it.\nBinet and Simon published three papers in 1905 that motivated the need for intelligence testing (Binet & Simon, 1905c), explained the new method (Binet & Simon, 1905b), and demonstrated results measurement of schoolchildren and institutionalized children who had been identified as “subnormal” (Binet & Simon, 1905a).\n\n7.0.2.1 Motivation\nWe have already discussed some of Binet’s motivations for creating an intelligence test. Decisions about child welfare were being made in France without the benefit of objective tests of mental abilities. Binet observed many opportunities for bias in the procedures for making judgments about children that would determine their futures. He thought an objective test would be a valuable tool to guard against bias, and increase the efficiency of how the state spent resources on social programs like education. As a description of the entire research enterprise, Binet wrote, “When the work, which is here only begun, shall have taken its definite character, it will doubtless permit the solution of many pending questions, since we are aiming at nothing less than the measure of the intelligence; one will thus know how to compare the different intellectual levels not only according to age, but according to sex, the social condition, and to race; applications of our method will be found useful to normal anthropology, and also to criminal anthropology, which touches closely upon the study of the subnormal, and will receive the principal conclusion of our study.” (Binet & Simon, 1905a).\n\n\n7.0.2.2 Method\nBinet created sets of psychological, pedagogical, and medical tests that he used to measure individual differences in children. On the whole, the approach was very similar to Cattell, in the sense that both were measuring as many physical and mental features of children and adults they could feasibly fit into a session where the measurements occurred. The major difference was that Binet had innovated on his psychological questions. Binet had many more than Cattell’s 10 questions, they covered a wider variety of tasks presumed to involve higher order mental abilities, and the questions were tailored for children at different ages, from 3 to 13, in yearly increments of difficulty.\nFigure fig-4Binet1 shows individual tasks that were determined to be appropriate to children in each year, from 3 to 13. Binet describes the individual tasks in great detail, along with instructions for administering each test, and scoring of each test.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Examples of questions and results from Binet’s mental testing procedure.\n\n\n\n\nTo give an example of results, panel B shows performance from seven and eleven year old children on the task, “immediate repetition of sentences of 14 to 15 words each”. In this task, a sentence was read aloud to a child, and the child had to repeat back the sentence exactly as many times as they could. Multiple measures of performance were taken, including total number of sentences repeated, and notes about “absurdities”, occurring when the child repeated something that was determined by the examiner to be absurd. There are two important features of the results that were common to all of the tests, and that were fundamental to Binet’s method. First, there were clear differences in task performance between children of different ages. For example, children at age seven recited fewer sentences than children at age eleven. To my eye, the average seven year old in the table (in the middle of the group) repeated about three sentences; whereas, the average eleven year old repeated about five sentences. Second, there were individual differences within children of the same age. Some children at age seven recited one or two sentences and others recited up to four or five sentences.\n\n\n7.0.2.3 Quantifying mental ability with Age\nBinet recognized that human intelligence was a large multi-dimensional concept, but he also sought methods to quantify intelligence in simplified terms that would be familiar and easy to use, like using a ruler to measure length. Binet wanted a test that used numbers like a ruler for intelligence: larger numbers would indicate more intelligence and smaller numbers would indicate less.\nOne of Binet’s problems was that he had many different varieties of tests, all which gave multiple measures of performance. He wanted to mash together the test results to a single dimension of numbers that would be simple, just like a ruler. Binet chose age in years. Age was simple like a ruler, going up in increments of one year at a time. Children also developed physically and mentally as they grew into adults. Binet’s basic theoretical assumption was that, on average, children’s mental abilities steadily increased every year until they became adults. Thus, children at age seven would have more general intelligence than at age five, and eleven year olds would have more intelligence than ten year olds.\nBinet invented a relative scale of measurement to capture his notion of human intelligence. The scale was relative to the average age of children. Adults and children alike could be measured, and the test would return a number in years. A precocious seven year old might have a mental age of eleven, or an adult the mental age of a three year old.\n\n\n7.0.2.4 Comparison to Norms\nBinet was well aware that none of his specific tests measured anything as complicated as intelligence. He wrote, “One test signifies nothing, let us emphatically repeat, but five or six tests signify something. And that is so true that one might almost say, ‘It matters very little what the tests are so long as they are numerous.’” (Binet & Simon, 1911). What mattered more than the individual tests was Binet’s innovation to compare test results from one individual to a larger group of individuals.\nBinet employed the concept of average children, and assumed that every year, on average, children made gains in intelligence. He needed real-world estimates of his theoretical average children. To create the estimates he simply measured hundreds of children of different ages on his tests. For example, he gave many three year olds his tests and recorded how they performed. In this way, Binet obtained norms or standards that could be used for comparison. For example, the data on three year olds would show a spread of results. Some three year olds received lower scores, some were in the middle, and some received higher scores on the tests. This spread of results then becomes an empirical standard for the mental abilities of all three year olds.\nA parent could have their three year old measured on the tests, and Binet could tell the parent how their child performed relative to the other three year olds he had measured. Or, if a child was tested and scored as having the mental abilities of a seven year old, this would roughly mean that the child performed similarly to the seven year olds that Binet had measured while he was developing his scale.\nBasing the measurement of mental abilities on a relative comparison to empirical norms is still very common in modern aptitude testing (e.g., the SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.), and the practice is otherwise known as standardized testing. One intriguing feature of the method is that the norms (e.g., what it means to be an average three year old, or four year old on the test) adjust themselves over time as more measurements are taken. For example, when Binet published his tests, he had only taken a limited number of measurements from three year olds, and these measurements served as the norms for three year olds. However, the norms for three year olds would update themselves as more three year olds were measured in the future.\n\n\n7.0.2.5 Computing intelligence scores\nIn 1905, Binet had an unruly number of tests, well over 50; and, part of the testing process was to measure individual children on as many of the tests as possible. How did Binet take performance measurements from all of the tests to arrive at a single value in years that would quantify mental ability? Another way to state this question is to ask, how did Binet calculate average performance for the children in each age group, and how were the results from new children compared to the results from the existing children in Binet’s database?\nThe answers are that Binet imposed rules for classification, and these rules determined how performance from individual tests were converted into an age in years. Binet experimented with different classification rules.\nA potential rule was, “A subject has the intellectual development of the highest age at which he passes all the tests, with the allowance of one failure in the tests for that age. Thus young Ernest has passed all the tests at nine years, except one; he has also passed all the tests at ten years except one; therefore we attribute to him the mental level of ten years.”(Binet & Simon, 1908)\nBy 1911, Binet settled on a more nuanced point system:\n“Here is the rule to follow: take for point of departure, the age at which all the tests are passed; and beyond this age, count as many fifths of a year as there are tests passed. Example: a child of eight years passes all the tests of six years, 2 of seven years, 3 of eight years, 2 of nine years, 1 of ten years; he has therefore the level of six years plus the benefit of eight tests or eight-fifths years, or a year and three-fifths, equaling a level of seven years and three-fifths, or more simply 7.6. This calculation permits the appreciation of the intellectual level by means of a fraction. But it must be well understood that this fraction is so delicate an appreciation, that it does not merit absolute confidence, because it varies appreciably from one examination to another.” (Binet & Simon, 1911).\n\n\n7.0.2.6 Binet’s use cases\nBinet achieved a method that would be used throughout the world to measure mental abilities. There are some strikingly simple properties of the test that make the method very seductive. The big idea was to create a large database of how children of various ages perform mental tasks, and then compare new people measured on the same tasks to the database. This would yield a “mental age”, a simple number that represented mental abilities relative to a large and growing database.\nOne of Binet’s use cases was to guard against bias when making decisions about child-welfare. Teachers might send children away to institutions just because they were unruly, and without an objective test of mental ability, the teacher could claim the unruly students were mentally unfit for school. Or, some children may have already been unjustly institutionalized, and without any objective way to show these children belong in a regular school, they would be forced to stay in the institution. Indeed, Binet tested institutionalized children (Binet & Simon, 1905c). On the one hand, he used these results to further validate his tests, because he was able to show that institutionalized children had lower “mental ages”, when compared to non-institutionalized children. Thus, low scores on his tests could be used to justify institutionalizing children. On the other hand, Binet also found cases where institutionalized children were shown to be of “normal” intelligence relative to their non-institutionalized peers. Thus, scores on the tests could potentially be used to save some children from institutionalization.\n\n\n7.0.2.7 Meaning of the measure\nWe have just reviewed one of the first so-called “intelligence” tests developed by psychologists. However, up to this point we have mostly avoided giving a definition to the word intelligence. So, what is a definition of the word intelligence? And, does the Binet-Simon test actually measure intelligence according to that definition? If not, what does it measure?\nOperational definitions are a research tool commonly used in psychology that will help us evaluate these issues. Operational definitions are used by individual researchers to specify the meaning of their own terms. For example, Binet could employ an operational definition of intelligence in terms of his own test. Here, the word intelligence would cease to have any common everyday meaning, and would only be used as a shorthand term to refer to patterns of performance on the test. And of course, just calling a test an “intelligence” test, doesn’t mean that it measures the everyday meaning of intelligence. Clear operational definitions can benefit research because they allow researchers to communicate effectively, with clarity, and with terms that are limited to the context of the research. Operational definitions can also cause confusion, especially when researchers choose terms that already have well-established meaning in everyday usage. For example, using “intelligence” as a name for a test could easily confuse people who might assume the name was actually meaningful with respect to the everyday concept of intelligence.\nConsidering how operational definitions work, I can not give a clear answer about whether or not Binet’s test actually measures intelligence. There are two problems. First, not everyone agrees on what intelligence is in the first place. Second, without an agreed upon definition, it is difficult to justify why each component of Binet’s test actually measures some component of intelligence in a meaningful way.\nWikipedia gives the following definition of intelligence:\n“Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.”\nFrom my perspective, the meaning of intelligence is large, varied, and has different meanings for different people, just like the word cognition. As a result, it is difficult for any test to claim that it measures something as diffuse as intelligence. An analogy might be to music. Imagine someone claiming they had a music test that measured whether a given recording had more or less music, like a person could be claimed to have more or less intelligence. Music is so highly diverse that it would be ridiculous (in my opinion) to try to measure all of music on a single scale with a “music test”. Plus, who get’s to define what music get’s counted as music? The surrounding issues that you might imagine would emerge from debates about a fictional music test, also surround debates about what intelligence tests mean.\nAlthough I won’t say I know what intelligence means, and I won’t claim that the Binet-Simon test measures intelligence, I will claim that the Binet-Simon test can be inspected, and it is possible to assess the meaning of the measurement based on the procedures of testing that Binet described. For example, Binet used a process of trial-and-error to create mini-tests of different abilities that were age-appropriate. Specifically, Binet arranged the tests such that most children of a given age were able to complete the tests assigned to their own age group, and complete the tests assigned to younger age groups, but not complete tests assigned to older age groups. Also, Binet chose tests that produced variation within an age group–some children of the same age would do better or worse on the same test. Binet measured many children of all age groups on the tests. Then he proposed to compare new children, measured on the same tests, to his growing database.\nSo what does the Binet-Simon test measure? It measures how a child’s performance on Binet’s chosen mini-tests, compares to performance on the same mini-tests by groups of children of different ages. This is not a straightforward measure like a ruler, where one inch on the ruler is one inch in the world. Although the Binet-Simon test produces a number in years, that refers to “mental age”; the number is deceiving because it depends on many components. The components include the actual mini-tests that Binet chose, the children that Binet tested to form the empirical comparison group, and the classification rules that Binet used to assign years to children based on their test performance. Changes to any or all of these many components would change how a child would be scored, and what the score would actually mean.\n\n\n\n7.0.3 Mental testing and eugenics in America\nAfter the Binet-Simon test was translated to English, it was popularized in America as the Stanford-Binet test. Even though the test had numerous issues and was not actually a test of intelligence, it was nevertheless used in a widespread way throughout America. Many of the American psychologists who would use the new intelligence test were also advocates and members or leaders in eugenics societies. As a result, intelligence testing was used in America as a tool to further the cause of the eugenics movement.\n\n7.0.3.1 The Alpha-Beta test\nIn 1917, the same year that America entered World War I, the APA appointed committees to study the situation and prepare for action (Yerkes, 1918), and the National Research Council created a Psychology Committee to examine similar issues (Yoakum & Yerkes, 1920). Many psychologist members of these committees were also members and proponents of eugenics, including: Robert Yerkes, Madison Bentley, Edward Thorndike, John B. Watson, Walter D. Scott, Robert Woodworth, and Carl Seashore (all of whom would take a turn as APA president).\nWar was a topic of considerable debate among eugenics societies (Kühl, 2013) interested in improving their race over generations. It was clear that many people would perish during war. On the one hand, according to the logic of eugenics if “low-quality” people tended to perish, then war could be positive for eugenics because those people would no longer be around to breed. On the other hand, “high-quality” people could be killed, and that would be a negative because their genes would be lost as well. Additionally, a practical issue stood in the way. There was no way to measure the eugenic quality of soldiers and then use that information to decide who would live or die during war. Eugenicists were advocates of using intelligence tests on soldiers to help make personnel selection decisions: such as who would become an officer, and who would have high probability of being killed by being sent to the front.\nAmerican Psychologist Robert Yerkes (APA president in 1917) wanted to establish a “mental census” of Americans, and then use that information to improve American society from a eugenics point of view. Yerkes urged testing of all Americans and organized the largest mass of American men for the draft, administering the test to 1.75 million adults (Yerkes, 1923). There were two versions of the test (inspired by Stanford-Binet). The “alpha” test was created for soldiers who could read, and the “beta” test was created for soldiers who could not.\nIn his 1923 report, “Eugenic Bearing of Measurements of Intelligence in the United States Army.”, Yerkes describes methods and results from the testing efforts and lists these five main reasons to conduct such widespread testing:\n\nIn the discovery of men whose superior ability recommends their advancement.\nIn the prompt segregation in the Development Battalions of intellectually inferior men whose inaptitude would retard the training of the unit.\nIn building organizations of equal or appropriate strength.\nIn selecting suitable men for various army occupations or for special training in the technical schools.\nIn eliminating the feeble-minded.\n\n\n\n7.0.3.2 Scientific Racism\nEugenics ideology typically included racist beliefs about the superior or inferior eugenic qualities of different ethnic groups (Turda, 2010). The Alpha-beta tests of 1.75 million American men also yielded results that fit existing eugenic ideology about inherent differences in intelligence between ethnic groups. For example, psychologist Carl Brigham, wrote an entire book analyzing the results of the Alpha-Beta tests (Brigham, 1922). He concluded that white Americans had superior intelligence to black Americans and immigrants. He also created dire warnings about the future of America, suggesting that American intelligence was rapidly declining. He warned that although American deterioration was imminent, it could be prevented through public action and laws. For example, eugenically inferior immigrants could be kept out of the country. And, increased segregation of whites and blacks, along with laws against intermarriage could prevent further mixing of the races.\nAs we discussed earlier, it is not entirely clear what these so-called intelligence tests measure, or what intelligence itself actually refers to. Nevertheless, proponents of eugenics were quick to claim that results from the tests really did legitimately measure supposedly intrinsic and genetically inherited qualities of humans that made some superior and others inferior. Alternative interpretations, such as the tests measured culturally acquired aptitudes, took additional time to be seriously considered. Unfortunately, racist motivations would continue to daunt intelligence testing in America, and an extended history is beyond the current scope of this chapter. Before we conclude this chapter and examine future developments in the cognitive sciences, I cover two more historical examples related to intelligence testing and American Society.\n\n\n7.0.3.3 Mental health\nThe eugenics movement deeply impacted public policy and stigma around mental health. We already mentioned that American eugenics proponents successfully petitioned for laws to legalize forcible sterilization of people deemed to be “feeble-minded”. The invention of intelligence tests was heralded as a new scientific tool for the identification of “feeble-minded” people, so that they could be segregated and/or sterilized. Psychologist Henry Goddard provides a case example of connecting intelligence testing to the eugenics agenda for treating mental health issues.\nGoddard was director of research at the Vineland Training School for Feeble-Minded Girls and Boys in Vineland, New Jersey. He also arranged for the English translation of Binet’s work in 1916 (Kite, 1916). Robert Yerkes visited Goddard and used his facilities at Vineland during the development of the Alpha-Beta test. Goddard was heavily involved in eugenics, and one illustrative example is from his 1927 article, “Who is a Moron?” (Goddard, 1927).\nGoddard describes new terms for categorizing levels of “feeble-mindedness” based on intelligence tests. For example, “idiots” had the mental age of two-year old children, “imbeciles” had the intelligence of three to seven year olds. Goddard invented the term “moron” to describe people with the same supposed intelligence as eight to twelve year olds. The rest of the article describes eugenic ideology in the form of panic about how society is in danger unless it acts to solve the moron problem. The morons were a problem because they appeared normal, and might only be identified with an intelligence test. As a result, hidden morons passing as normal people were running amok in society, and they also had many children, so they were potentially deteriorating the gene-pool by breeding. He considered extreme eugenic solutions, and wrote, “perhaps our ideal should be to eventually eliminate all the lower grades of intelligence and have no one who is not above the twelve-year intelligence level”, but he also cautioned that eliminating half of society would be impossible and even undesirable. Instead, Goddard proposed that morons could be cured through education, and become very useful to society as workers who would very happily do the jobs they were trained to do.\nThe issues in mental health were similar to what happened in the military. Intelligence tests were forwarded as legitimate scientific measures of human quality and used to make decisions about the welfare of American citizens and their position in society.\n\n\n7.0.3.4 Education and The Black Psychologists\nAs a final example, the methods involved in intelligence testing became widespread in education in the form of standardized testing. Similar to previous examples, proponents of eugenics were involved in these efforts. For example, the SAT was created by Carl Brigham shortly after he published his book on “A study of American Intelligence” (Brigham, 1922). The eugenical ideals were that tests could be used to sort children in terms of their quality, and then give more resources to the education of superior children, and fewer resources to the education of inferior children.\nTesting of American children showed achievement gaps between different ethnic groups. And, to fast forward into the 1960s, there was growing concern among Black Psychologists (only 1% of a primarily white discipline at the time) that educational testing and decision-making policy was harming outcomes for Black children. In 1968, the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) was formed as a national organization during the San Francisco meeting of the American Psychological Association (APA) (for a more complete history see, R. Williams, 1974). The ABPsi was formed both to address needs within the small community of Black Psychologists that were not being met by the APA, and to petition the APA to address many broader concerns. For example, the ABPsi adopted the following statement on testing:\n“The Association of Black Psychologists fully supports those parents who have chosen to defend their rights by refusing to allow their children and themselves to be subjected to achievement, intelligence, aptitude and performance tests, which have been and are being used to:\n\nLabel black children as uneducable;\nPlace black children in special classes;\nPotentiate inferior education; .\nAssign black children to lower educational tracks than whites:\nDeny black children higher educational opportunities; and\nDestroy positive intellectual growth and development of black children.”\n\nThe ABPsi’s calls for a moratorium on testing (Graves & Mitchell, 2011; see also, R. L. Williams & Mitchell, 1978) in 1969 were not supported by the APA , whose membership also had financial interests in the large educational testing industry. Although there were efforts to maintain a relationship with the APA, the ABPsi became a distinct professional organization and has been publishing its own journal since 1974. ABPsi has been on the forefront of modern research on the impact and legacy of eugenics and racism in Psychology. Finally, although testing is still widespread in America, a moratorium on intelligence testing of Black children was accomplished in 1979 through advocacy of Black Psychologists in California (Frisby & Henry, 2016), where the practice remains illegal.\n\n\n\n7.0.4 Cognition: Testing abilities vs. testing theories\nThis textbook is aimed at providing an overview of research into cognition. One piece of that history involves psychologists who were advocates of the eugenics movement who created tests of cognitive abilities with the purpose of applying those tests on society to further the aims of the eugenics movement. The role of eugenics in motivating the need to create tests of cognitive ability, and in spreading the use of those tests across society is not commonly discussed in introductory textbooks. However, the historical context raises important questions about how the enterprise of scientific research contributes to societies that fund it, and we should be mindful of these issues as we move onto other topics in cognition. For example, it is clear that psychologists researching human cognition can produce tools of questionable merit that become widely adopted in society, and that continue to have positive and negative outcomes for different groups of people in society.\nThe next chapter transitions to more conventional areas in cognitive psychology, like the domains of learning and memory. We will encounter more examples of cognitive tasks that are very similar, if not essentially the same, as the mini-tests used as part of intelligence scales. However, rather than testing for the purpose of measuring and classifying the qualities of people, we will discuss examples where cognitive tasks are used to test theories and claims about how cognition works.\n\n\n7.0.5 Appendix\n\n7.0.5.1 References\n\n\n\n\nBinet, A., & Simon, T.

    "text": "12.0.1 Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior\nThe period of behaviorism in American psychology had a sizeable influence on the character of memory research that would follow in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. And, it is worth mentioning one of the transitional points between behaviorism and cognitive approaches to explain why so much of this chapter will be about memory for words.\nIn 1938, B.F. Skinner published his book on a behaviorist approach to animal learning. However, Skinner also sought to apply his behaviorism to people, and all of their behavior as well. In 1947, Skinner’s William James lectures at Harvard developed an extension of behaviorism to human language. The idea was that human language involved verbal behavior, and that principles of behaviorism could be applied to the domain of verbal behavior. Just like a science of behaviorism could determine how environmental stimuli could be manipulated to control a behavioral response in an animal, behaviorism could also determine the functional principles controlling the output of verbal responses in people. His lectures were widely circulated in unpublished form, and were eventually published in 1957, in the book “Verbal Behavior” (Skinner, 1957). At the same time, other domains like psycholinguistics were also developing, and Noam Chomsky famously critiqued the prospects of a behaviorist science of human language in his review of Skinner’s book (Chomsky, 1959). One of the issues caught hanging in the balance was whether or not cognitive processes would be necessary for a successful account of language.\nSubsequently, behaviorist and cognitivist research streams emerged on topics of verbal behavior. Skinner’s behaviorist approach to verbal behavior was followed up in behaviorist journals in the 60s, and some research in that tradition continued at a small pace (Eshleman, 1991). In 1962, following a growing interest in verbal behavior from the emerging cognitive tradition (Cofer, 1978), a new journal was created called “The Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior”, and later renamed “Journal of memory and language” in 1985. Many other journals published memory research over that time period, but I am highlighting this journal for three reasons. First, the papers in that journal track several notable developments in memory that we will discuss in this chapter. Second, the journal shows how ideas from the study of associative learning guided the renewed interest in experimental research on human memory. Last, if you ever wondered why memory research uses words as stimuli so often, it might have something to do with the verbal learning and verbal behavior phase of memory research.\nTo make one more historical note, the growing divide between Skinner’s operant behaviorism and cognitive psychology is nicely documented in Blough and Millward’s 1965 review, “Learning: Operant Conditioning and Verbal Learning”. They begin by quoting Kendler saying “In general, learning theorists understand each other much better than did their ancestors of two decades ago. Neobehaviorists, S-R functionalists, and statistical theorists can communicate easily with each other. Skinnerians also find it easy to communicate among themselves”. The paper then reviews operant conditioning research in part A, and verbal learning in part B, with little overlap between the two research traditions. Their review of verbal learning also provides a bird’s eye view of the increasingly wide-ranging empirical and theoretical concerns that was becoming a new era of cognitive psychology. Much of the work revolved around learning and memory.\n\n\n12.0.2 Memory Methodology\nWe have seen a few different memory tasks in the last chapter. Ebbinghaus memorized lists of nonsense syllables. Bartlett used the method of serial reproduction. Von Restorff had people memorize pairs of items. There was the immediate memory span task, and free-recall for lists of words. Many more memory tasks have been used in the study of learning and memory. Some of these tasks become very popular and generate bursts of research interest. This section describes general properties of memory tasks, and throughout the rest of this chapter we will encounter specific examples of the tasks in action.\nMemory tasks typically involve two phases: encoding and retrieval. Generally speaking, the encoding phase involves the presentation of stimuli for a later memory test in the retrieval phase. For example, there were two phases in the free-recall experiments from last chapter showing the serial-position effect. In the encoding phase, participants were presented with a list of words. In the retrieval phase, participants were asked to recall as many words as they could. The encoding and retrieval phases could also overlap depending on how the experiment was conducted. For example, a participant could encode some items, then try to remember them, then encode some new items, and so on.\nMemory tasks typically involve experimental manipulation of factors in the encoding and retrieval phases. One aim of the experiments is to determine which factors influence performance in the memory task. Another aim can be to test theories of memory processes. For example, some theories may make predictions about the extent to which the factors will influence memory performance. The addition of experimental manipulations can change almost any aspect of the basic task setup.\nSome common manipulations include the following. The kind of information or stimuli presented or learned in the task. Stimuli can be words, pictures, artificial stimuli like nonsense syllables, or sounds, movies, sentences, and more. The frequency of presentation of items. The order of presentation of items. The temporal delay between the encoding phase and the later memory test. Manipulations can also include what the participant does to information during the encoding phase, or how they are asked to remember it in the retrieval phase. If you can think of something that might increase or decrease your ability to remember information, I’d say there is a good chance that a memory researcher may have tried the manipulation at some point in a published experiment.\nMemory tasks also involve different methods for measuring memory performance. For example, in the free recall task, a participant could be given a blank sheet of paper and asked to write down as many words as they can remember, in any order. In this task, memory performance could be measured as the number of words correctly written down. There are other tasks as well, such as the recognition task. In a recognition memory task, the retrieval phase involves presenting items to a participant, and having them judge whether the item is new (not presented in the encoding phase) or old (was presented in the encoding phase). Importantly, memory performance depends on the task used to measure memory.\n\n12.0.2.1 Issues with measuring memory: the case of recognition\nThe recognition task is a good example to alert you to a common interpretation problem in memory research. The issue is that the choice and structure of a task can easily influence measurements of memory performance. For example, in a recognition memory task the retrieval phase involves a person making judgments about stimuli they have seemn before, and stimuli they have not seen before. Old items from the encoding phase may be presented, and the correct answer is to identify them as old. New items that were not shown in the encoding phase are also presented, and the correct answer is to identify them as new.\nOne of the issues is that participants can always achieve 100% correct on the old items. All they have to do is say “old” for every item in the test, both old and new items. In this case, it would be obvious that the participant was not discriminating between old and new items, because they would also be 100% incorrect on the new items. This thought experiment highlights the fact that the recognition task can involve a discrimination judgment between old and new items. The ability to tell the difference between old and new items is commonly measured by hits and false alarms.\n\n12.0.2.1.1 Hits, False Alarms, misses and correct rejections\nHits and false alarms come from an analysis technique called signal detection theory (Green & Swets, 1966), commonly used to describe performance in recognition memory tasks. The table below shows the relationship between response in a recognition memory task, and terms in signal detection theory:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD ITEM\nNEW ITEM\n\n\n\n\nRESPOND OLD\nHIT (Correct Answer)\nFALSE ALARM (Incorrect Answer)\n\n\nRESPOND NEW\nMISS (Incorrect Answer)\nCORRECT REJECTION (Correct Answer)\n\n\n\nA hit is correctly identifying an old item as old. A false alarm is incorrectly identifying a new item as old. We will not go more deeply into signal detection at this point. However, the hit and false alarm rates can be used to measure whether a person can discriminate between old and new items. If the hit and false alarms are equal, like 100% hits and 100% false alarms, then the person is not showing evidence they can tell the difference between old and new items. However, if the hit rate is greater than the false alarm rate, like 80% hits and 20% false alarms, then the person is showing evidence they can make the discrimination. The important aspect is that memory performance in the recognition task is assessed with both hit and false alarm, and not solely on the basis of one measure like proportion correct (hit rate).\n\n\n12.0.2.1.2 Choosing the lures (new items)\nThe discrimination aspect of the recognition task raises the issues of which items to use as lures or new items in the task. Memory researchers sometimes use the word lures to describe new items in a recognition memory test, referring to whether or not participants will take the bait and claim to have recognized the lure even though it was not presented in the encoding phase. The issue with choosing lures or new items, is that recognition performance will improve or worsen depending on whether the lures are easy or hard to discriminate from the old items.\nImagine an encoding phase were you read a list of 20 words that all began with the letter A. Then, in a recognition test you read one word at a time, and were asked to judge whether the word was old (from the list) or new (not from the list). How well do you think you would perform this task if all of the new words also began with the letter A, compared to a situation where all of the new words began with the letter Z? The recognition task would be very easy when all of the new words started with Z, and were obviously different from the words that began with A in the original list. The recognition task would be harder if the new words started with A, and were chosen to be very similar words to the studied list.\nThe take home message from this discussion is that performance in a memory task may not necessarily involve memory processes, but could involve other cognitive abilities and processes that participants use to perform the task at hand. Memory researchers are well aware of these nuances, and are often at pains to experimentally control aspects of memory tasks to rule out confounding processes or interpretations. I raise these general issues of interpretation to encourage a little bit of caution when reading through the next section on memory phenomena. Here we will go through a list of findings from memory tasks. These findings are suggestive of general principles about how memory works, but they also reflect the specific ways that people perform laboratory tasks used in memory research.\n\n\n\n\n12.0.3 Memory Phenomena\nThe term memory phenomena refers to findings from performance in laboratory-based memory tasks. It could refer more broadly to everyday aspects of memory as well. For example, the feeling of déjà vu is an experience where people feel as though they have lived through a present moment before. This section will focus mostly on laboratory-based phenomena. There are more laboratory phenomena of memory than can fit in this chapter, so I have chosen some that are in my estimation reasonably representative of the very large literature. I will start by reminding you of some phenomena we have already discussed, and then continue with a small laundry list of newer phenomena.\n\n12.0.3.1 Temporal Delay\nAs we know from Ebbinghaus’ research on the forgetting curve, memory performance tends to decline with increasing temporal delays between encoding and retrieval. Memory experiments often include a manipulation of delay, such as a short delay of 5 to 20 minutes, to longer delays of days, weeks, or months. In general, memory performance is usually worse after longer than shorter delays. But, memory can change in interesting ways over time, and manipulations of delay are known to interact with other factors too.\n\n\n12.0.3.2 Distinctiveness\nVon Restorff showed that memory for a set of “isolated” items that were all different from one another was better compared to a set of “massed” items that were all similar to one another. In other words, memory performance in her task was better for the distinctive items. There have been many demonstrations that distinctiveness can influence later memory performance, and researchers continue to be interested in distinctiveness phenomena.\n\n\n12.0.3.3 Serial Position\nIn the last chapter we saw that the order of items in a list (serial position) influenced memory performance in a free recall task. People generally recalled more words from the beginning (primacy) and ending (recency) of the list, compared to the words in the middle of the list. The relative size of primacy and recency effects can also depend on the format of the memory test (e.g., recall vs. recognition) (Oberauer, 2003).\n\n\n12.0.3.4 Mental Imagery\nIf you remember way back to the chapter on mental imagery, we learned about Paivio’s work showing that memory performance is better for words that evoke more imagery than words that do not.\n\n\n12.0.3.5 Stimulus effects: Picture Superiority\nNot surprisingly, the format of stimuli used in memory experiments influence memory performance. The picture superiority effect provides one example. As the old saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words”, which apparently works for memory too. Several papers have reported that pictures are remembered better than words, in both recall tasks (Paivio et al., 1968) and recognition tasks (Gehring et al., 1976).\nMore recently, Hockley showed the picture superiority effect extended to another kind of recognition task called “associative recognition” (Hockley, 2008). In this task participants saw pairs of items in the encoding phase. The item pairs were concrete noun words, or pairs of line drawings. In the recognition phase, participants saw word or picture pairs from the encoding phase, or rearranged versions of the pairs. Participants were better at recognizing the old pairs when they were pictures compared to words.\n\n\n12.0.3.6 Frequency effects\nThe frequency or number of times you encounter an item can influence later memory performance. For example, memory recall can improve for items presented more than once during learning Peterson (1966).\nThe number of times an item is presented during an encoding phase can also influence performance in a recognition task. For example, Hintzman showed a case where item frequency had no effect on recognition accuracy, but did influence the speed of recognition judgments (Hintzman, 1969). However, this was a curious case, and I bring it up to quickly mention the concept of ceiling and floor effects. A ceiling effect occurs when performance is at the top a scale and can’t go upward any further. For example, in Hintzman’s study, participants were close 100% accurate in their recognition judgments for all items. The task was easy enough that they were at the ceiling after seeing an item only one time, and the remaining presentations of the item did not improve their performance, because they were already perfect. A floor effect is the opposite case, where performance is at the bottom of a scale, and is unable to go down further. Even though Hintzman’s participants had near perfect recognition memory, the effect of item frequency was still evident on the reaction time measure. Recognition judgments became faster as the number of item presentations increased.\nAlthough higher frequency of experience generally translates to greater memorability, there are exceptions to the rule. In the previous examples, the frequency manipulation was applied in the encoding phase, and some items were presented more than others before the memory test. What about frequency effects for stimuli like words that have been encountered by participants outside of the context of a memory experiments? Some words occur with high frequency in the natural language, which means you encounter the words fairly often. For example, here are some very high frequency words: the, and, a to, said, in, was, you, but, that, etc. Low frequency words occur less often, and some examples are: aardvark, magnolia, caboose, filament, cassette, harmonize. In memory a task, the words presented during an encoding phase can be manipulated by their frequency of occurrence in the natural language. Interestingly, manipulations of word frequency influence memory performance in different ways depending on the task. For example, in a free recall task people generally recall more high frequency words than low frequency words; however, in a recognition task, people often recognize low frequency words more accurately than high frequency words Balota & Neely (1980).\n\n\n12.0.3.7 Presentation rate and spacing\nThe role of frequency invites further questions the conditions surrounding the presentation and repetition of the item. For example, for how long is the item presented during the encoding phase? If the item will be repeated again, when will it be repeated? It could be repeated right away, or after some number of other items have been presented. The factors of presentation time and spacing between repetitions both influence memory performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Results from Melton (1970).\n\n\n\n\nThe joint effects of presentation rate and spacing of repetitions are shown in Figure fig-9Melton_1970, and taken from an experiment by Melton and Shulman (Melton, 1970). The encoding phase varied how long participants viewed each word, and used presentation rates of 1.3, 2.3, and 4.3 seconds. The graph shows that probability of recall goes up as participants had more time with each word during the encoding phase. This experiment also included repetitions of some words throughout the encoding phase. Importantly, the repetitions were separated, or spaced out, by 0, 2, 4, 8, 20, or 40 intervening words. The graph shows in general that recall probability is higher for words presented twice, compared to only once. But, it also shows an effect of the spacing manipulation. Recall was improved for repetitions that were more spaced out compared to repetitions that occurred with fewer intervening events.\n\n\n12.0.3.8 Retro-active and pro-active interference\nMemory tasks may involve multiple lists of stimuli, or multiple encoding and retrieval phases. Memory performance for a particular list, or performance in one of the tests, can depend on the other lists and tests. These influences are generally termed retroactive and proactive interference, and have been objects of research interest for many years (Britt, 1935).\n\n12.0.3.8.1 Retroactive interference\nRetroactive interference refers to cases when subsequent learning activities in the future influence prior learning from the past. Retroactive interference can be observed in designs with multiple phases, and is the finding that memory performance for items from a first phase can depend on tasks performed in a second phase.\nPostman provides a clear example (Postman, 1952). In a first phase (called original learning), subjects encoded 24 nonsense syllables and were then given a memory test. In a second phase (called interpolated learning), subjects in the experimental group were given 24 new nonsense syllables to remember, and subjects in a control group read the New Yorker magazine instead. In the final phase, everyone was retested for the items from the first list.\nIn general, everyone was better on the first test compared to the second retest. In other words, everyone forgot some of the nonsense syllables between the first and second test. However, the experimental group showed even more forgetting than the control group. Remember, the experimental group had to learn a second list of nonsense syllables after the first. This second learning is described as “retroactively” interfering with memory for items from the first list. Postman also showed in that more retroactive interference occurred when memory was tested with a recall procedure compared to a recognition procedure.\n\n\n12.0.3.8.2 Proactive interference\nProactive interference happens when previous learning activities from the past interferes with current learning activities in the present. For example, Ebbinghaus experienced proactive interference as he was learning his lists of nonsense syllables. In this case, his memory for a current list was influenced by the number of lists that he had previously learned.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Results from Underwood (1957).\n\n\n\n\nFigure fig-9Underwood_1957 from Underwood (Underwood, 1957) shows evidence of proactive interference compiled across several studies involving learning lists of items. The y-axis measures the percent of items recalled for a current list, the x-axis shows how many other lists had been previously learned. The curve shows that recall is very high when few lists were previously learned, and recall gets worse and worse as more lists were previously learned.\n\n\n\n12.0.3.9 Number of associates and the Fan effect\nPeople have extensive background experience with words as they appear in natural language. Importantly, words in natural language are not like random collections of words often used in memory tests. Instead, words appear in sentences in highly structured ways. One important aspect of the structure is word frequency: some words appear more than others in the language. Another important aspect is word co-occurrence: words occur together with other words in sentences. Some words co-occur with many other words, and have a high number of associates; whereas, other words co-occur with fewer other words, and have a small number of associate. More generally, any item can be paired with more or less associates, referred to as the item’s fan (associated items). And, the size of an item’s fan influences memory processes (Anderson & Reder, 1999). For example, the time to recognize an item increases as its fan, or the number of associated items increases.\nAnderson demonstrated fan effects in a memory test for propositional sentences (Anderson, 1974). Participants studied sentences describing two concepts, a person in a location. Examples are presented in @ fig-9Fan_effect. Across the studied sentences, each concept was associated with one, two, or three facts. For example, the “hippie” person appeared in three locations, “park”, “church”, and “bank” (fan of 3). Similarly, the “park” location was visited by three people, the “hippie”, “captain”, and “fireman” (fan of 3). The lawyer only appeared in the cave, so both had a fan of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Design from Anderson (1974).\n\n\n\n\nDuring the memory test subjects were shown original sentences that they had studied (target probes), or re-arranged sentences (foil probes) containing new pairings of the same people in different locations. Anderson showed that participants recognition time to accept target sentences, and to reject foil sentences increased as the fan for each word in the test sentence increased. A reproduction of the data reported by Anderson is shown in Figure fig-9Fan_effect2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Reproduced results from Anderson (1974).\n\n\n\n\nAll of the target sentences were studied during the encoding phase. It took longer to recognize a target sentence as the “person” and/or location “words” in the sentence had more facts associated with them. In general it took longer to reject the foil sentences, but it also took longer as a function of the number facts associated with each word in the sentence. So, a “fan effect” was observed for both studied sentences and re-arranged (foil) sentences.\n\n\n12.0.3.10 Meaningfulness\nMeaningfulness influences memory performance, but the construct of meaningfulness is not as straightforward as some of the previous factors. Two examples of meaningfulness effects in memory are presented below. In general, more meaningful stimuli are more memorable than less meaningful stimuli.\n\n12.0.3.10.1 The self-reference effect\nThe self-reference effect suggests that relating information to yourself can help you remember it better (Donovan & Radosevich, 1999). The original study (Rogers et al., 1977) had participants encode lists adjectives in different ways to contrast shallow versus meaningful processing of the words. Shallow processing involved judging whether or not the word had big or small letters, or rhymed with another word. The most meaningful task presented adjectives along with the question, “Describes you?”. Subjects simply had to respond “yes” or “no”. The results showed memory for adjectives was highest for the words in the self-reference condition, when subjects had to consider whether or not the word described them.\n\n\n12.0.3.10.2 Meaningful context\nBransford and Johnson demonstrated an important role for meaningful context to support memory recall and comprehension (Bransford & Johnson, 1972). They had participants read a short paragraph for a later comprehension and memory test. The paragraph is reprinted below.\n\nIf the ballons popped, the sound wouldn’t be able to carry since everything would be too far away from the correct floor. A closed window would also prevent the sound from carrying, since most buildings tend to be well insulated. Since the whole operation depends on a steady flow of electricity, a break in the middle of the wire would also cause problems. Of course, the fellow could shout, but the human voice is not loud enough to carry that far. An additional problem is that a string could break the instrument. Then there could be no accompaniment to the message. It is clear that the best situation would involve less distance. Then there would be fewer potential problems. With face to face contact, the lest number of things could go wrong.\n\nThis paragraph was designed to be difficult to comprehend without further context. Each sentence could make some sense by itself, but as a whole, it may not be very clear what this paragraph is about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Full Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Partial\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Context pictures used in Bransford & Johnson (1972).\n\n\nThe critical manipulation in this experiment was whether participants received additional meaningful context, in the form of a cartoon picture. Figure fig-9Bransford_context shows the pictures used in the full and partial context conditions. One group saw the full context cartoon image before they read the paragraph. Another group saw the same image after they read the paragraph. If you thought the paragraph was confusing before, try reading it while looking at this image to get a feel for how it could help support your comprehension of the paragraph.\nAnother group of participants were given the “partial context” cartoon picture. And, two last groups were not given any context at all. The “no context (1)” group received one opportunity to read the paragraph. The “no context (2)” group got to read the paragraph twice.\nAfter the encoding phase, participants were given a comprehension test and a recall memory test. The question was whether or not the presence or absence of meaningful context would influence comprehension scores, and number of ideas recalled from the paragraph. Figure fig-9Bransford_data shows the results from the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Data from Bransford & Johnson (1972).\n\n\n\n\nThe comprehension test had a maximum score of seven. The context before group had the highest comprehension score (6.1), compared to all other groups. The recall test had a maximum score of 14. Again, the context before group had the highest recall score (8), compared to all other groups. Notably, all of the groups performed fairly similarly to one another, showing very little influence of reading the paragraph twice, seeing a partial context cartoon, or even getting the full context cartoon after initially reading the paragraph. The conclusion was that, in this case, receiving meaningful context before reading the paragraph was an important pre-requisite for later comprehension and recall.\n\n\n\n12.0.3.11 Context effects\nHave you ever walked into a room looking for something, and then forgot what you were looking for, or why you had went into the room? And, then went back into the room you came from and suddenly remembered the goal you had forgotten? This is an everyday example of an environmental context effect on memory. In this case, it seems like the room you are in can be a powerful remember of your current goals.\nSimilar effects of environmental context on memory performance have been demonstrated by memory researchers. For example, Godden and Baddeley (Godden & Baddeley, 1975) showed evidence of context-dependent memory in a group of underwater divers. They conducted their experiment at a dive location outside of a normal laboratory context. They had divers encode words in one of two locations on land or under water; and, then they had divers recall words in the same or different locations from where they encoded the words. All of the words were presented as audio using headphones. One group heard the words in a dry environment before they went for the dive; then, half of those divers were given a memory test in the same dry environment, and the other half went underwater and were given the memory test in the wet environment. Another group heard the words first underwater in the wet environment, and were tested underwater (wet) or on land (dry). The question was whether memory recall would be better if the encoding and retrieval contexts were the same (dry-dry, wet-wet) versus different (dry-wet, wet-dry).\nThe results from the experiment are presented in Figure fig-9Godden_Baddeley_data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Data from Godden & Baddeley (1975).\n\n\n\n\nThe divers recalled more words when the encoding and and retrieval (learning and recall) environments matched. For example, they recalled 13.4 and 11.4 words in the matching dry-dry and wet-wet conditions. However, they only recalled 8.4 and 8.6 words in the wet-dry and dry-wet conditions.\n\n\n12.0.3.12 Generation Effect\nThe generation effect (Bertsch et al., 2007) refers to the finding that generating information yourself can improve memory performance. For example, Slamecka and Graf (Slamecka & Graf, 1978) demonstrated participants had much better memory for words they generated themselves, compared to words they read.\nTheir procedure involved a manipulation during the encoding phase. Participants either generated words or read words for a later memory test. In the generate condition, participants were shown cards with a word followed by a letter, and instruction to help them generate a word. For example, in the synonymn condition participants saw rapid-F, and had to generate rapid-FAST. In the reading condition, participants were shown rapid-FAST, and simply read the two words. There were a few different rules for the generation task, like generate an associate, the category label, an opposite, a synonym, or a rhyme word.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Data from Slamecka & Graf (1978).\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the experiment are shown in Figure fig-9Generation_effect. In all cases, the probability of recognizing a word was higher for generated words, compared to words that were read. They also found evidence that memory was better for generated than read words in a recall task, and in confidence judgments, where people are asked how confident they are about their recognition decisions.\n\n12.0.3.12.1 Enactment and Production Effects\nEnactment and production effects are similar to generation effects in memory. For example, the production effect (MacLeod et al., 2010) shows that memory can be better for words that are read out loud (produced) versus read silently. And, enactment effects (Engelkamp et al., 1994) shows that instructions are remembered better if they are carried-out (enacted) or imagined-to-be enacted versus not.\n\n\n\n12.0.3.13 Testing effect (Retrieval practice)\nHave you ever wondered why some experiences are memorable than others? The testing effect suggests that the act of remembering an event itself can make the event easier to remember the next time. The testing effect, also called the retrieval-practice effect, occurs when people show better memory for items they have practiced retrieving or remembering compared to items that have not received similar amounts of practice (Roediger III & Butler, 2011).\nOne demonstration of the testing effect involved participants learning to read, remember, and understand two short English passages from the TOEFL (The Test of English as a Foreign Language) (Roediger III & Karpicke, 2006). There was a learning phase, separated by a 5 minute, 2 day, or 1 week retention interval, followed by a memory test to recall as many “idea units” from the paragraphs as possible.\nThe learning phase involved a within-subjects manipulation, which means that each person contributed data to both conditions of the experiment. In the study-study condition, participants studied one passage for 7 minutes, and then they re-studied the paragraph for 7 minutes. In the study-test condition, participants studied one passage for 7 minutes, and they were given a recall memory test, and asked to remember as many ideas from the passage as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Data from Roediger III & Karpicke (2006)\n\n\n\n\nAfter the learning phase, participants were given a final recall test following a 5 minute, 2 Day, or 1 week delay. The results are shown in Figure fig-9Test_enhanced. The study-study group remembered the most ideas after a minute delay, but they remembered fewer and fewer ideas across 2 days and 1 week. The study-test group also remembered fewer ideas across the retention interval, but after 2 days and w 1 week they recalled more ideas than the study-study group. The take home finding was that the act of practicing remembering, rather than restudying the material, helped people remember more information over a longer period of time.\n\n\n12.0.3.14 Directed forgetting\nDirected forgetting effects occur when memory performance is influenced by instructions to remember or forget information (Basden & Basden, 2013). For example, Geiselman (1974) had subjects read one sentence at a time for a later memory test. After each sentence, participants were presented with an “R”, which meant they would be later tested on their memory for the sentence; or an “F”, which meant they would not be tested on their memory for the sentence, and they could “forget” the sentence. However, subjects were given memory tests for all of the sentences, even the ones they were told to forget.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: Data from Geiselman (1974)\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the experiment are shown in Figure fig-9Direct_forgetting. TBR stands for “to-be-remembered”, and TBF stands for “to-be-forgotten”. Using a free-recall task, participants recalled fewer sentences that were directed to be forgotten (TBF), compared to sentences that were directed to be remembered. The general trend was also obtained for other tests of memory, like sentence completion and multiple choice, but the largest difference was observed with free-recall.\n\n\n12.0.3.15 Summary: Memory Effects\nThe above section lists numerous memory phenomena that have been investigated by cognitive psychologists. This is not a complete list, and the effects here were chosen to give a rough sample of the kinds of experiments and findings in this domain. Each of the effects listed here has been reproduced several times and in various ways. Most of the effects have also received substantial further investigation. For example, you may have not noticed that I did not offer any explanations of the above effects. In most cases, a great deal of additional experimental work has been conducted to test explanations and theories for each of the above effects, and many more. Instead of pursuing these issues in their minute detail, the rest of the chapter focuses on some broader themes in memory research. These include the concepts of memory processing principles, described next.\n\n\n\n12.0.4 Memory processing principles\nThe above list presents a large number of phenomena that a theory of memory processes could be expected to explain. Although we could spend the rest of this chapter discusses a few theories and models of memory that have been created to explain some of these effects, we will instead touch on some more general memory processing principles. As a sidenote, we will examine another memory model in more detail in the computational modeling chapter.\nMemory processing principles are general rules of thumb for memory. They are not laws, because memory is a complex process and doesn’t always behave in ways that can be described by simple laws. For example, whether or not memory performance will improve or decline under particular conditions is often an empirical question, where the answer is determined by creating the situation and observing what happens. Nevertheless, memory researchers have proposed general principles of processing that appear to broadly characterize several aspects of memory performance.\n\n12.0.4.1 The levels of processing principle\nIn the 1970s, Craik and Lockhart proposed the levels of processing principle to characterize several emerging patterns of performance that were spread across numerous findings. The levels of processing principle refers generally to the idea that strength and quality of encoding determines later memory. The principle distinguishes roughly between shallow and deep levels of encodings. For example, a shallow level of encoding would involve brief presentations with minimal additional processing, like reading or hearing some words for a short amount of time. Depth of processing at encoding could be increased by requiring additional operations beyond simply perceiving an item. The levels of processing principle suggests that memory is best for information given deep-encoding compared to shallow encoding.\nThe general idea of levels of processing captures several trends in the list of memory effects. For example, the self-reference effect was developed as a general test of the levels of processing idea. In that study, words that were given shallow encoding were remembered worse than words given deeper encoding. The mental imagery, meaningfulness, generation, enactment, and production effects, could all reflect examples where more elaborate or deeper encoding led to better memory performance.\nThe levels of processing principle was criticized for its apparent circularity. The principle was not a theory of memory processes, and did not explain the mechanisms involved in shallow or deep encoding. Instead, deep versus shallow encoding was inferred from measures of memory performance.\n\n\n12.0.4.2 Context-dependent and Cue-dependent memory\nThere are many ways that memory appears to be dependent on context (Smith, 1994). On the one hand, context effects in memory are a phenomena in need of explanation. On the other hand, they point at a kind of general principle: context matters for encoding and retrieval.\nDuring encoding, the formation of mental representations for new information is assumed to include contextual information. For example, encoding a picture of a face might include mental representations for objects in the foreground, like the face, and the scene in the background. In this case the scene could be acting as the context for the face. The word context is often used very generally, and one thing in general could serve as “context” for another thing.\nDuring retrieval, memory is assumed to operate in a cue-driven manner. Specifically, a cue to memory can initiate and aid retrieval. For example, in everyday life you may have had the experience of “being reminded” of one thing, as a result of thinking or encountering another thing. Similarly, in a laboratory memory experiment, cues presented at retrieval can aid memory performance. For example, people may remember fewer words in a free recall task compared to a cued-recall task, that involves hints related to the words learned during the encoding phase.\nPutting the encoding and retrieval roles for context together, we get the idea that memory performance can benefit from matching encoding and retrieval contexts. If the cues that were encoded as contexts during encoding (e.g., a background scene) are represented at a later time, they can serve as a cue to memory to retrieve contextually associated information (e.g., a face) that was encoded together during encoding.\n\n\n12.0.4.3 Encoding specificity principle\nThe encoding specificity principle was proposed by Tulving and Thompson (Tulving & Thomson, 1973), and is very similar to the previous principle. Here is the principle stated in the words of the authors:\n\n“In its broadest form the [encoding specificity] principle asserts that only that can be retrieved that has been stored, and that how it can be retrieved depends on how it was stored. In its more restricted senses, the principle becomes less truistic and hence theoretically more interesting. For instance, we assume that what is stored about the occurrence of a word in an experimental list is information about the specific encoding of that word in that context in that situation. This information may or may not include the relation that the target word has with some other word…If it does, that other word may be an effective retrieval cue. If it does not, the other word cannot provide access to the stored information because its relation to the target word is not stored.”\n\nThe encoding specificity principle suggests that the details of how information was encoded in the first place matter for later memory retrieval. This principle is very similar to the previous one, with a greater emphasis on the processing that occurred during encoding, rather than the mere presence of contextual information. For example, according to the encoding specificity principle, contextual information present during memory encoding may or may not play help later retrieval; it all, depends on how the contextual information was encoded. If some target information was encoded in relation to its context, then contextual cues may be useful for retrieval later on. However, if the operations that occurred during encoding did not focus much on contextual information, then contextual cues may not be very useful as retrieval cues later on.\n\n\n12.0.4.4 TIP/TAP: Transfer-inappropriate and transfer-appropriate processing\nThe last memory principle is called the transfer appropriate processing principle. Sometimes it is also called TIP/TAP, for transfer-inappropriate vs. transfer-appropriate processing. The big idea here is that “cognitive processing” at both encoding AND retrieval matters for memory. In other words, how a person makes use of prior information encoded by memory depends on how the information was encoded in interaction with the demands of present task. Cognitive processing refers very broadly to the things, task, or other operations that a person does during encoding and retrieval. The principle suggests better memory when there is a match between the processing done at encoding and the processing required at test. In this case, the learning that occurred during encoding is appropriate for, and tranfers well to, the task required at retrieval. At the same time, worse memory performance may be observed when their is a mismatch between encoding and retrieval processing. In this case, the learning that occurred during encoding does not transfer well to the task at retrieval.\nThe TIP/TAP principle further qualifies the preceding principles. For example, memory depends on how deeply you encode information (levels of processing), the context around the encoding episode (context-dependent memory), and how the information is encoded (encoding-specificity principle); but, memory performance will also depend on the nature of the processing required by the retrieval task. According to TIP/TAP, previous information becomes more available when retrieval processing conditions match well with encoding processing conditions, and becomes less available when the conditions mismatch. As a result, it is possible for memory to depend on very specific encoding and retrieval conditions. For example, failure to remember an item could be due to a failure of encoding, or a failure to produce the specific retrieval conditions necessary to cue memory for the item.\n\n12.0.4.4.1 Morris, Bransford and Franks\nIn one demonstration, Morris, Bransford, and Franks (Morris et al., 1977) showed that the tasks performed at encoding and retrieval can influence memory performance. They used a design typical of levels processing research, where subjects encoded words semantically (in a sentence) to encourage deep processing, or in a rhyming condition to encourage more shallow phonetic processing. In general, subjects should show better recognition memory for the semantically processed words compared to the phonetically processed words. The twist in the experiment was to include two different tests of recognition memory: a standard test, and another test involving rhyming. For example, in the standard test, subjects heard an old or new word and responded yes or no (to identify the word as old). In the rhyming test, subjects heard a rhyming cue word, and were asked to judge whether they heard a word that rhymed with the cue word during encoding. For example, if subjects had received EAGLE during encoding, they might be given the word LEGAL as a rhyming cue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Data from Morris et al. (1977)\n\n\n\n\nFigure fig-9Tip_Tap shows how tasks at encoding and retrieval influence memory performance. First, in the standard recognition memory test, the proportion of words recognized was higher for the semantic (.84) compared to rhyme (.63) encoding conditions. This result is in line with the levels of processing idea that words given deeper semantic encoding should be easier to remember than words given shallow phonetic encoding. However, looks what happened to memory performance in the rhyming test condition. In this case, rhyming recognition performance was worse for the semantic (.33) than the rhyming (.489) condition. In this case, the memory test involved cognitive operations related to rhyming, which apparently made it easier to remember words that were encoded with rhyming related operations compared to words that were not.\n\n\n\n\n12.0.5 Procedures of Mind\nIn the next chapter on implicit cognition we will continue to discuss some aspects of memory, including implicit influences on memory and learning. As a transition to those themes, I end this chapter with a skill-based memory framework that provides an interesting perspective on themes we have just finished talking about, and the ones we will discuss next.\nProcedures of mind refers to a paper by Kolers and Roediger in 1984 (Kolers & Roediger, 1984) that outlines a skill-learning and task-based view of cognition and memory. The general idea is that cognition can be understood in terms of tasks that people perform, and the collections of specific skills they learn to perform the tasks. The collections of specific skills are termed “procedures of mind”. In this framework, a major problem for cognition is to understand how skill-learning in one situation or task transfers to other tasks and components of tasks. To provide a concrete example we will consider some of Kolers research on reading words upside down.\n\n12.0.5.1 Kolerian Reading\nPaul Kolers (Roediger III & Craik, 1987) (1926-1986) published several papers over his career on phenomena associated with learning to read geometrically transformed text. Figure fig-9Procedures_text shows some examples of rotations and mirror inversions to text. If you try reading each of the sentences, you may notice that some of the transformations are easier to read and others are harder to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: Examples of geometrically rotated text from Kolers & Roediger (1984).\n\n\n\n\nKolers ran many kinds of experiments where people practiced the skill of reading geometrically transformed text (Kolers, 1976a, 1976b). Several of his important findings are illustrated by the learning and transfer curves in the next graph. In this experiment (Kolers & Magee, 1978), participants practiced reading text for up to 7 one hour long sessions. They all received the exact same text, however one group practiced reading words out loud, and the other group practiced naming the letters in each word out loud.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Results from Kolers & Magee (1978).\n\n\n\n\nFigure fig-9Procedures_transfer shows the results. A first important finding was that people get better at both tasks with practice. Everyone struggled to read the inverted words and letter at the beginning, but they all got faster as they practiced more passages.\nThe second and more important finding was that people showed some general and some selective skill learning. In particular, the task of reading text or naming letters appeared to change the kinds of skills that were learned. And, each task required some similar and some different skills. As a result, learning from one task transferred to another in different ways.\nAfter learning 15 passages, the participants in the naming letters conditions (white dots) were transferred to the reading text condition. The skills they acquired while letter naming positively transfered to the task of reading words. For example, the black dot at passage 16 had a reading time comparable to the reading time after 4 passages from the reading text group. This result showed that practice with letter naming of rotated text generalized to reading whole words of rotated text.\nHowever, the reverse pattern of generalization was not obtained. For example, at the very end of the experiment there was another transfer test. The most striking result is from the reading text group (black triangle) who had been reading text the entire time, and were never asked to try the task of naming letters until the very end. They showed minimal transfer to the letter naming task (white triangle). Although the group had read 25 passages, and were very fast at reading rotated words, those skills were equivalent to having practiced letter naming for two or three passages.\nThe two skills of letter naming and word reading seem very close, and although there is some overlap between them, people also learn unique sets of skills to recognize the unique details of rotated letters versus words. And, as we will see in other examples of skill-learning in later chapters, it is fairly common for skill-learning to be highly specific and fail to transfer from one situation to another.\n\n\n\n12.0.6 Appendix\n\n12.0.6.1 References\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, J.
