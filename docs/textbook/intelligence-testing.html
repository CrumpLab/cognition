</h2>
<p>Warning, my training as a cognitive psychologist mostly skipped over the topic of mental testing, especially the history and development of intelligence tests. So, this is my ongoing attempt to organize some of that history and connect it with issues in cognition. I have found the history to be complex and often extremely fraught. Although mental testing is widespread and has many proponents and use cases; mental testing is also intertwined with the eugenics movement, and the practice of mental testing has negatively impacted marginalized groups. The scientific and social merits/pitfalls of intelligence testing have been continuously debated in domains where mental testing has been introduced.</p>
<p>This section will cover aspects of the socio-historical context around the development of intelligence tests, a quick look at examples of early intelligence tests and how the tests work, some discussion of the concept of intelligence in relation to these tests, and some historical examples of how the tests were used in the context of the eugenics movement.</p>

<p>The Stanford-Binet test was among the first intelligence tests to be widely adopted and used in America. Alfred Binet (1857-1911) was a French psychologist who published the Binet-Simon test (with his student Theodore Simon) in 1905,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetNewMethodsDiagnosis1905" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet, A., &amp;amp; Simon, T. (1905). New methods for the diagnosis of the intellectual level of subnormals. &lt;em&gt;L’Année Psychologique&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;12&lt;/em&gt;, 191–244&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>35</sup></a></span> which described revised intelligence tests Binet was working on for over a decade prior.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-nicolasProgramIndividualPsychology2014" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Nicolas, S., Coubart, A., &amp;amp; Lubart, T. (2014). The program of individual psychology (1895-1896) by &lt;span&gt;Alfred Binet&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;Victor Henri&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;LAnnee Psychologique&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vol. 114&lt;/em&gt;(1), 5–60. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-psychologique1-2014-1-page-5.htm" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-psychologique1-2014-1-page-5.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>36</sup></a></span> Lewis Terman was an American psychologist at Stanford University, who helped popularize Binet’s test in America,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-termanMeasurementIntelligenceExplanation1916" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Terman, L. M. (1916). &lt;em&gt;The &lt;span&gt;Measurement&lt;/span&gt; of intelligence: &lt;span&gt;An&lt;/span&gt; explanation of and complete guide for the use of the stanford revision and extension of the &lt;span&gt;Binet&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;Simon Intelligence Scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Houghton Mifflin&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com?id=qtmdqoFx55YC" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;http://books.google.com?id=qtmdqoFx55YC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>37</sup></a></span> hence Stanford-Binet. Also in 1916, Psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_H._Goddard">Henry Goddard</a> published an English translation (by Elizabeth Kite) of five of Binet’s papers on intelligence testing in a book titled “The Development of Intelligence in Children.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-kiteDevelopmentIntelligenceChildren1916" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Kite, E. S. (1916). &lt;em&gt;The development of intelligence in children (&lt;span&gt;The Binet&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;Simon Scale&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Williams &amp;amp; Wilkins Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>38</sup></a></span> The entire book is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://archive.org">internet archive</a>.</p>
<p>It is convenient to start with the Stanford-Binet test, because Terman and Binet represent somewhat dueling progressive notions (for the time) about how psychological science could and should be used to improve society. These dueling notions involve the nature/nurture debate about the heritability and fixed or flexible nature of mental abilities; and the implications of that debate for enacting social policy that follow from taking different sides of the debate.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, countries were finding ways to respond to social issues (crime, education, mental healthcare) with social institutions and policies, and academics were discussing how science could make responses more efficient and less resource demanding. The eugenics movement, of which Terman was a strong proponent, billed itself as a progressive movement capable of fixing societies ailments. Social problems were explained by hereditary influences, solutions included measures that would prevent “defective” people from breeding. In the domain of mental health, people labelled “feeble-minded” were institutionalized and placed under care of the state. Building, maintaining, and staffing buildings took resources; but, from the perspective of eugenics, the investment was worth the cost because the institutions allowed “defective” people to be segregated from society. Segregating and institutionalizing people for crimes or mental health reasons was a widespread practice before the advent of mental tests. From Terman’s perspective,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-termanMeasurementIntelligenceExplanation1916" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Terman, 1916&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>39</sup></a></span> intelligence tests would have obvious benefits for negative and positive eugenics policies. For negative eugenics, mental testing would make institutionalization even more effective at segregating unwanted people from society. For example, in envisioning how testing could be applied to discover hidden “defective” schoolchildren he wrote, “it is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection of society. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency.” Furthermore, intelligence testing could also be used for positive eugenics, by identifying hidden geniuses and grooming them to become national leaders; Terman wrote, “The number of children with very superior ability is approximately as great as the number of feeble-minded. The future welfare of the country hinges, in no small degree, upon the right education of these superior children.”</p>
<p>Binet did not presume that mental abilities were fixed or inherited, and he argued that presumptions about human intelligence were premature in the absence of rigorous tests providing objective evidence on the matter. Binet was also hired by the French government to address pressing issues in education. For example, without objective mental tests, French schoolchildren were already being divided up into “normal” children, sent to regular school, and “defective” children sent to special schools or otherwise institutionalized. Binet saw the existing methods for deciding the fate of children as deeply flawed, arbitrary, open to numerous forms of bias, and a drain government resources. One set of concerns involved child welfare. The lack of accurate testing meant that some normal children were accidentally being institutionalized for the wrong reasons. Relatedly, Binet speculated that education could improve mental abilities, even of “sub-normal” children. Another set of concerns involved efficiencies for society. Binet also considered that educational resources could be wasted on children not capable of learning. As a progressive, he also envisioned a high-functioning utopian society where science was able to accurately test every person for their aptitudes, and then assign people to tasks in society with utmost efficiency.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetDevelopmentIntelligenceChild1908" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet, A., &amp;amp; Simon, T. (1908). The &lt;span&gt;Development&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span&gt;Intelligence&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;L’Année Psychologique&lt;/em&gt;, 1–90&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>40</sup></a></span> But, those lofty ideas could not be accomplished without a scientifically accurate intelligence test.</p>
<p>The race to develop intelligence tests was more like a relay race. Researchers were vying to create intelligence tests that withstood scientific and public scrutiny. These tests would be handed off like batons to officials involved in decision-making at the level of social institutions and government. Researchers and practitioners took different sides on the nature/nurture debate and assumed mental abilities were inherited and fixed at birth, or flexibly acquired over development. These assumptions tinted interpretation of test results, and biased decision-making and implementation of social programs. For example, what should happen to children who are mentally inferior according to an intelligence test? A eugenicist and hereditarian might argue these children should be institutionalized and refused education, because they were genetically incapable of learning, would never contribute to society, and worse would further pollute the gene pool if they had children. Alternatively, psychologists like Binet were open to the possibility that mental abilities could be developed and acquired with experience, and that education systems could be improved to meet needs of children with low to high mental abilities. The next sections explore iterations of research that culminated in Binet’s intelligence test; followed by examples of how the tests were applied in the United States.</p>

</h3>
<p>We already mentioned that Galton’s research on individual differences in the vividness of mental imagery from 1880, was an early attempt to measure mental abilities associated with intelligence. Galton’s work, including his eugenics ideas, inspired many psychologists to develop better mental tests. For example, James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944), published “Mental tests and Measurements” in 1890.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-cattellMENTALTESTSMEASUREMENTS1890" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;CATTELL, J. McK. (1890). V.—&lt;span&gt;MENTAL TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Mind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;os-XV&lt;/em&gt;(59), 373–381. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/dhn9nc" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/dhn9nc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>41</sup></a></span> Cattell made numerous contributions to American psychology, and continues to be honored by the Association for Psychological Sciences (APS) through their “James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award” for lifetime achievement. Like Galton, Cattell was also a proponent of eugenics.</p>
<p>Here is the first paragraph from Cattell’s paper:</p>
<hr>
<p>“Psychology cannot attain the certainty and exactness of the physical sciences, unless it rests on a foundation of experiment and measurement. A step in this direction could be made by applying a series of mental tests and measurements to a large number of individuals. The results would be of considerable scientific value in discovering the constancy of mental processes, their interdependence, and their variation under different circumstances. Individuals, besides, would find their tests interesting, and, perhaps, useful in regard to training, mode of life or indication of disease. The scientific and practical value of such tests would be much increased should a uniform system be adopted, so that determinations made at different times and places could be compared and combined.”With a view to obtaining agreement among those interested, I venture to suggest the following series of tests and measurements, together with methods of making them."</p>
<hr>
<p>Cattell was corresponding with Galton to make the tests, “meet with his approval,” but he only indirectly references the application of mental testing to the eugenics movement (e.g., “indication of disease”), and he mentions several other reasons to pursue the creation of mental tests. In a footnote, he mentions that, “the nationality (including that of the parents), and the age, sex, occupation and state of health” should all be recorded when participants take the test". The inclusion of these measurements is consistent with eugenical aims to show that different races had inherited different mental abilities.</p>
<p>Cattell proposed to measure each person on ten tests:</p>
<p>I. Dynamometer Pressure, (to measure squeezing hand strength).
II. Rate of Movement (how fast you can move your hand).
III. Sensation-areas (telling apart two pin-pricks)
IV. Pressure causing Pain
V. Least noticeable difference in Weight
VI. Reaction-time for Sound
VII. Time for naming Colours
VIII. Bi-section of a 50 cm line
IX. Judgment of 10 seconds time
X. Number of Letters remembered on once Hearing</p>
<p>You might notice these individual tests range across physical and mental abilities, and none of them measure a complicated concept like human intelligence. At the end of the paper, Cattell lists 50 additional tests for sight (14 tests), Hearing (8 test), Taste and Smell (3 tests), Touch and Temperature (7 tests), Sense of Effort and Movement (4 tests), Mental Time (7 test), Mental intensity (2 tests), and Mental Extensity (5 tests), that he thought should be important for the incoming discipline of Experimental Psychology. Many of the tests became useful for theorizing about how individual psychological processes work.</p>
<p>By 1896, Cattell had moved from Pennsylvania to New York City, and where he published measurements of Columbia university students.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-cattellPhysicalMentalMeasurements1896" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Cattell, J. McKeen, &amp;amp; Farrand, L. (1896). Physical and mental measurements of the students of &lt;span&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;(6), 618. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/ckms9q" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/ckms9q&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>42</sup></a></span> By today’s standards, Cattell’s test would likely raise privacy concerns about what he was planning to do with the data he collected. Cattell reported statistics on hair and eye color, height and weight, head-size, breathing capacity, color-blindness, vision, color preferences, hearing, pitch-perception, skin-sensation, hand-strength, reaction-time, perception of time and space, memory, and mental imagery. In addition, the examiner made separate judgments of each students quality (physical goodness, good student, level of intellectual ability, strong-will etc.), based on their professional opinion. Finally, students were given a lengthy questionnaire to report on their family history, medical history, and daily behaviors, and preferences (what’s your favorite novel, what gives you pleasure, etc.). Cattell concludes that science should proceed to determine the interrelations between his measurements, and how much knowing one thing about a person can predict something else about them. He also concludes that “we must use our measurements to study the development of the individual and of the race, to disentangle the complex factors of heredity and environment,” and that the most important thing that science can do is guide the development of man.</p>

Binet proposed that individual differences in higher mental abilities could be measured by simple tests, but only if the tests were mentally challenging. He proposed tests for Memory–drawing a geometric shape from memory, reproducing a sentence from memory, memory for musical notes, memory for a color, memory for 12 objects–tests for Mental Imagery; Imagination; Attention– duration of attention, size of attentional field, performing multiple tasks at once–tests for understanding–give a definition, criticize a sentence–tests for suggestibility; for Aesthetic feeling–what are a persons preferences, are they same as artists?–tests of Moral Feelings; muscular and will power; and motor skill and glance.
As Binet might have predicted, Cattell’s initial mental testing program flopped. Cattell tried to demonstrate he could predict students’ grades in college from their scores on his mental test, but he wasn’t able to reliably reproduce the relationship. It seemed obvious that college grades should measure something about mental abilities. If Cattell was measuring mental abilities with his tests, then students with high scores should have high grades, and students with low scores should have low grades. Such a positive correlation would provide validity to Cattell’s mental ability tests. However, multiple attempts to show that test performance positively correlated with grades, instead showed no consistent correlation. One interpretation was that Cattell’s tests were not measuring mental abilities like a person’s general intelligence.</p>

<p>We have already discussed some of Binet’s motivations for creating an intelligence test. Decisions about child welfare were being made in France without the benefit of objective tests of mental abilities. Binet observed many opportunities for bias in the procedures for making judgments about children that would determine their futures. He thought an objective test would be a valuable tool to guard against bias, and increase the efficiency of how the state spent resources on social programs like education. As a description of the entire research enterprise, Binet wrote, “When the work, which is here only begun, shall have taken its definite character, it will doubtless permit the solution of many pending questions, since we are aiming at nothing less than the measure of the intelligence; one will thus know how to compare the different intellectual levels not only according to age, but according to sex, the social condition, and to race; applications of our method will be found useful to normal anthropology, and also to criminal anthropology, which touches closely upon the study of the subnormal, and will receive the principal conclusion of our study.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetApplicationNewMethods1905" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet &amp;amp; Simon, 1905&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>51</sup></a></span></p>

</h3>
<p>Binet described psychological, pedagogical, and medical batteries of tests that he used to measure individual differences in children. On the whole, the approach was very similar to Cattell, in the sense that both were measuring as many physical and mental features of children and adults they could feasibly fit into a session. The major difference was that Binet had innovated on his psychological questions. Binet had many more than Cattell’s 10 questions, they covered a wider variety tasks presumed to involve higher order mental abilities, and the questions were tailored for children at different ages, from 3 to 13, in yearly increments of difficulty.</p>
<p>The figure below shows individual tasks that were determined to be appropriate to children in each year, from 3 to 13. Binet describes the individual tasks in great detail, along with instructions for administering each test, and scoring of each test.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="imgs/Binet_1905.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>To give an example of results, panel B shows performance from seven and eleven year old children on the task, “immediate repetition of sentences of 14 to 15 words each.” In this task, a sentence was read aloud to a child, and the child had to repeat back the sentence exactly as many times as they could. Multiple measures of performance were taken, including total number of sentences repeated, and notes about “absurdities,” occurring when the child repeated something that was determined by the examiner to be absurd. There are two important features of the results that were common to all of the tests, and that were fundamental to Binet’s method. First, there were clear differences in task performance between children of different ages. For example, children at age seven year recited fewer sentences than children at ege eleven. To my eye, the average seven year old in the table (in the middle of the group) repeated about 3 sentences; whereas, the average eleven year old repeated about 5 sentences. Second, there were individual differences within children of the same age. Some children at age seven recited one or two sentences and other recited up to 4 or 5 sentences.</p>

</h3>
<p>Although Binet recognized that human intelligence was a large multi-dimensional concept, he nevertheless sought methods to quantify intelligence in simple ways, like using a ruler to measure length. Objects have different lengths that can be precisely measured with a ruler. Binet wanted a test that used numbers in a similar way for intelligence: larger numbers would indicate more intelligence and smaller numbers would indicate less.</p>
<p>One of Binet’s problems was that he had many different varieties of tests, all which gave multiple measures of performance. He wanted to mash together the test results to a single dimension of numbers that would be simple, just like a ruler. Binet chose age in years. Age was simple like a ruler, going up in increments of one year at a time. Children also developed physically and mentally as they grew into adults. Binet’s basic theoretical assumption was that, on average, children’s mental abilities steadily increased ever year until they became adults. Thus, children at age seven would have more general intelligence than at age five, and eleven year olds would have more intelligence than ten year olds.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Binet would invent a relative scale of measurement to capture what he claimed was human intelligence. The scale was relative to the average age of children, an intuitive number. Adults and children alike could be measured, and the test would return a number in years. A precocious seven year old might have a mental age of eleven, or an adult could be shown to have the mental abilities of a three year old.</p>

</h3>
<p>Binet was well aware that none of his specific tests measured anything as complicated as intelligence. He wrote, “One test signifies nothing, let us emphatically repeat, but five or six tests signify
something. And that is so true that one might almost say, ‘It matters very little what the tests are so long as they are numerous.’.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetNewInvestigationsMeasure1911" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet, A., &amp;amp; Simon, T. (1911). New investigations upon the measure of the intellectual level among school children. &lt;em&gt;L’Année Psychologique&lt;/em&gt;, 145–201. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/c4b7b9" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/c4b7b9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>52</sup></a></span> What mattered more than the individual tests was Binet’s innovation to compare test results from one individual to a larger group of individuals.</p>
<p>Binet employed the concept of average children, and assumed that every year, on average, children made gains in intelligence. He needed real-world estimates of his theoretical average children. To create the estimates he simply measured hundreds of children of different ages on his tests. For example, he gave many three year olds his tests and recorded how they performed. In this way, Binet obtained norms or standards that could be used for comparison. For example, the data on three year olds would show a spread of results. Some three year olds received lower scores, some were in the middle, and some received higher scores on the tests. This spread of results then becomes an empirical standard representing three year mental abilities. A parent could have their three year old measured on the tests, and Binet could tell the parent how their child performed relative to the other three year olds he had measured. Or, if a child was tested and scored as having the mental abilities of a seven year old, this would roughly mean that the child performed similarly to the seven year olds that Binet had measured while he was developing his scale.</p>
<p>Basing the measurement of mental abilities on a relative comparison to empirical norms is still very common in modern aptitude testing (e.g., the SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.), and otherwise known as standardized testing. One intriguing feature of the method is that the norms (e.g., what it means to be an average three year old, or four year old on the test) adjust themselves over time as more measurements are taken. For example, when Binet published his tests, he had only taken a limited number of measurements from three year olds, and these measurements served as the norms for three year olds. However, the norms for three year olds would update themselves as more three year olds were measured in the future.</p>

</h3>
<p>In 1905, Binet had an unruly number of tests, well over 50; and, part of the testing process was to measure individual children on as many of the tests as possible. How did Binet take performance measurements from all of the tests to arrive at a single value in years that would quantify mental ability? Another way to state this question is to ask, how did Binet calculate average performance for the children in each age group, and how were the results from new children compared to the results from the existing children in Binet’s database?</p>
<p>The answers are that Binet imposed rules for classification, and these rules determined how performance from individual tests was converted into an age in years. Binet experimented with different classification rules.</p>
<p>A potential rule was, “A subject has the intellectual development of the highest age at which he passes all the tests, with the allowance of one failure in the tests for that age. Thus young Ernest has passed all the tests at nine years, except one; he has also passed all the tests at ten years except one; therefore we attribute to him the mental level of ten years.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetDevelopmentIntelligenceChild1908" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet &amp;amp; Simon, 1908&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>53</sup></a></span></p>
<p>By 1911, Binet settled on a more nuanced point system:</p>
<p>“Here is the rule to follow: take for point of departure, the age at which all the tests are passed; and beyond this age, count as many fifths of a year as there are tests passed. Example: a child of eight years passes all the tests of six years, 2 of seven years, 3 of eight years, 2 of nine years, 1 of ten years; he has therefore the level of six years plus the benefit of eight tests or eight-fifths years, or a year and three-fifths, equaling a level of seven years and three-fifths, or more simply 7.6. This calculation permits the appreciation of the intellectual level by means of a fraction. But it must be well understood that this fraction is so delicate an appreciation, that it does not merit absolute confidence, because it varies appreciably from one examination to another.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetNewInvestigationsMeasure1911" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet &amp;amp; Simon, 1911&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>54</sup></a></span></p>

</h3>
<p>Binet achieved a method that would be used throughout the world to measure mental abilities. There are some strikingly simple properties of the test that make the method very seductive. The big idea was to create a large database of how children of various ages perform mental tasks, and then compare new people, measured on the same tasks, to the database. This would yield a “mental age,” a simple number that represented mental abilities relative to a large and growing database.</p>
<p>One of Binet’s use cases was to guard against bias when making decisions about child-welfare. Teachers might send children away to institutions just because they were unruly, and without an objective test of mental ability, the teacher could claim the unruly students were mentally unfit for school. Or, some children may have already been unjustly institutionalized, and without any objective way to show these children belong in a regular school, they would be forced to stay in the institution. Indeed, a major part of Binet’s early demonstrations involved testing institutionalized children.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-binetNecessityEstablishingScientific1905" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Binet &amp;amp; Simon, 1905&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>55</sup></a></span> On the one hand, he used these results to further validate his tests, because he was able to show that institutionalized children had lower “mental ages,” when compared to non-institutionalized children. Thus, low scores on his tests could be used to justify institutionalizing children. On the other hand, Binet also found cases where institutionalized children were shown to be of “normal” intelligence relative to their non-institutionalized peers. Thus, scores on the tests could potentially be used to improve unjust treatment of children.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.7</span> Meaning of the measure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meaning-of-the-measure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We have just reviewed one of the first so-called “intelligence” tests developed by psychologists. However, up to this point we have mostly avoided giving a definition to the word intelligence. So, what is a definition of the word intelligence? And, does the Binet-Simon test actually measure intelligence according to that definition? If not, what does it measure?</p>
<p><strong>Operational definitions</strong> are a research tool commonly used in psychology that will help us evaluate these issues. Operational definitions are used by individual researchers to specify the meaning of their own terms. For example, Binet could employ an operational definition of intelligence in terms of his own test. Here, the word intelligence would cease to have any common everyday meaning, and would only be used as a shorthand term to refer to patterns of performance on the test. And of course, just calling a test an “intelligence” test, doesn’t mean that it measures the everyday meaning of intelligence. Clear operational definitions can benefit research because they allow researchers to communicate effectively, with clarity, and with terms that are limited to the context of the research. Operational definitions can also cause confusion, especially when researchers choose terms that already have well-established meaning in everyday usage. For example, using “intelligence” as a name for a test could easily confuse people who might assume the name was actually meaningful with respect to the everyday concept of intelligence.</p>
<p>Considering how operational definitions work, I can not give a clear answer about whether or not Binet’s test actually measures intelligence. There are two problems. First, not everyone agrees on what intelligence is in the first place. Second, without an agreed upon definition, it is difficult to justify why each component of Binet’s test actually measures some component of intelligence in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Wikipedia gives the following definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence">intelligence</a>:</p>
<p>“Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.”</p>
<p>From my perspective, the meaning of intelligence is large, varied, and has different meanings for different people, just like the word cognition. As a result, it is difficult for any test to claim that it measures something as diffuse as intelligence. An analogy might be to music. Imagine someone claiming they had a music test that measured whether a given recording had more or less music, like a person could be claimed to have more or less intelligence. Music is so highly diverse that it would be ridiculous (in my opinion) to try to measure all of music on a single scale with a “music test.” Plus, who get’s to define what music get’s counted as music? The surrounding issues that you might imagine would emerge from debates about a fictional music test, also surround debates about what intelligence tests mean.</p>
<p>Although I won’t say I know what intelligence means, and I won’t claim that the Binet-Simon test measures intelligence, I will claim that the Binet-Simon test can be inspected, and it is possible to assess the meaning of the measurement based on the procedures of testing that Binet described. For example, Binet used a process of trial-and-error to create mini-tests of different abilities that were age-appropriate. Specifically, Binet arranged the tests such that most children of a given age were able to complete the tests assigned to their own age group, and complete the tests assigned to younger age groups, but not complete tests assigned to older age groups. Also, Binet chose tests that produced variation within an age group–some children of the same age would do better or worse on the same test. Binet measured many children of all age groups on the tests. Then he proposed to compare new children, measured on the same tests, to his growing database.</p>
<p>So what does the Binet-Simon test measure? It measures how a child’s performance on Binet’s chosen mini-tests, compares to performance on the same mini-tests by groups of children of different ages. This is not a straightforward measure like a ruler, where one inch on the ruler, is one inch in the world. Although the Binet-Simon test produces a number in years, that refers to “mental age”; the number is deceiving because it depends on many components. The components include the actual mini-tests that Binet chose, the children that Binet tested to form the empirical comparison group, and the classification rules that Binet used to assign years to children based on their test performance. Changes to any or all of these many components would change how a child would be scored, and what the score would actually mean.</p>

Watson, Walter D. Scott, Robert Woodworth, and Carl Seashore (all of whom would take a turn as APA president).</p>
<p>War was a topic of considerable debate among eugenics societies,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-kuhlBettermentRaceRise2013" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Kühl, 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>58</sup></a></span> interesting in improving their race over generations. It was clear that many men would perish during war. On the one hand, according to the logic of eugenics, if “low-quality” men tended to perish, then war could be positive for eugenics, because those men would no longer be around to breed. On the other hand, “high-quality” men could be killed, and that would be a negative, because their genes would be lost as well. Additionally, a practical issue stood in the way, there was no process to measure the eugenic quality of soldiers, and then use that information to bias who is likely to live or die during war. Eugenicists were advocates of using intelligence tests on soldiers to help make personnel selection decisions, such as who gets to become an officer, and who gets to have a high probability of being killed by being sent to the front.</p>
<p>American Psychologist Robert Yerkes (APA president in 1917) overarching goal was establish a “mental census” of Americans, and then use that information to improve American society from a eugenics point of view. Although he urged testing of all Americans, Yerkes only carried out the largest mass testing on American men for the draft, administering the test to 1.75 million adults.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-yerkesEugenicBearingMeasurements1923" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Yerkes, Robert M.

<p>Eugenics ideology typically included racist beliefs about the superior or inferior eugenic qualities of different ethnic groups.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-turdaRaceScienceEugenics2010" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Turda, M.

For example, psychologist Carl Brigham, wrote an entire book analyzing the results of the Alpha-Beta tests.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-brighamStudyAmericanIntelligence1922" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Brigham, C. C.

He also created dire warnings about the future of America, suggesting that American intelligence was rapidly declining. He warned that although American deterioration was imminent, it could be prevented through public action and laws. For example, eugenically inferior immigrants could be kept out of the country. And, increased segregation of whites and blacks, along with laws against intermarriage could prevent further mixing of the races.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, it is not entirely clear what these so-called intelligence tests measure, or what intelligence itself actually refers to. Nevertheless, proponents of eugenics were quick to claim that results from the tests really did legitimately measure supposedly intrinsic and genetically inherited qualities of humans that made some superior and others inferior. Alternative interpretations, such as the tests measured culturally acquired aptitudes, took additional time to be seriously considered. Unfortunately, racist motivations would continue to daunt intelligence testing in America, and an extended history is beyond the current scope of this chapter. Before, we conclude this chapter and examine future developments in the cognitive sciences, I cover two more historical examples related to intelligence testing and American Society.</p>

<p>The eugenics movement deeply impacted public policy and stigma around mental health. We already mentioned that American eugenics proponents successfully petitioned for laws to legalize forcible sterilization of people deemed to be “feeble-minded.” The invention of intelligence tests was heralded as a new scientific tool that aid in the identification of “feeble-minded” people, so that they could be segregated and/or sterilized. Psychologist Henry Goddard provides a case example of connecting intelligence testing to the eugenics agenda for treating mental health issues.</p>
<p>Goddard was Director of Research at the Vineland Training School for Feeble-Minded Girls and Boys in Vineland, New Jersey; and had published an English translation of Binet’s work in 1916.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-kiteDevelopmentIntelligenceChildren1916" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Kite, 1916&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>62</sup></a></span> Robert Yerkes visited Goddard and used his facilities at Vineland, during the development of the Alpha-Beta test. Goddard was heavily involved in eugenics, and one illustrative example is from his 1927 article, “Who is a Moron?”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-goddardWhoMoron1927" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Goddard, H. H. (1927). Who is a moron? &lt;em&gt;The Scientific Monthly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;24&lt;/em&gt;(1), 41–46&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>63</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Goddard describes new terms for categorizing levels of “feeble-mindedness” based on intelligence tests. For example, “idiots” had the mental age of two-year old children, “imbeciles” had the intelligence of three to seven year olds. Goddard invented the term “moron” to describe people with the same supposed intelligence as eight to twelve year olds. The rest of the article describes eugenic ideology in the form of panic about how society is in danger unless it acts to solve the moron problem. The moron’s were a problem because they appeared normal, and might only be identified with an intelligence test. As a result, hidden morons passing as normal people were running amok in society, and they also had many children, so they were potentially deteriorating the gene-pool by breeding. He considered extreme eugenic solutions, and wrote, “perhaps our ideal should be to eventually eliminate all the lower grades of intelligence and have no one who is not above the twelve-year intelligence level,” but he also cautioned that eliminating half of society would be impossible and even undesirable. Instead, Goddard proposed that moron’s could be cured through education, and become very useful to society as workers who would very happily do the jobs they were trained to do.</p>
<p>The overarching issues in mental health were very similar to what happened in the military. Intelligence tests were being forwarded as legitimate scientific measures of human quality that should be used to make decisions about the welfare of American citizens and their position in society.</p>

</h3>
<p>As a final example, the methods involved in intelligence testing became widespread in education in the form of standardized testing. Similar to previous examples, proponents of eugenics were involved in these efforts. For example, the SAT was created by Carl Brigham, shortly after he published his book on “A study of American Intelligence.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="references.html#ref-brighamStudyAmericanIntelligence1922" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Brigham, 1922&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>64</sup></a></span> The eugenical ideals were that tests could be used to sort children in terms of their quality, and then give more resources to the education of superior children, and fewer resources to the education of inferior children.</p>
<p>Testing of american children showed achievement gaps between different ethnic groups. And, to fast forward into the 1960s, there was growing concern among Black Psychologists (only 1% of a primarily white discipline at the time) that educational testing and decision-making policy was harming outcomes for Black children. In 1968, the <a href="https://abpsi.org">Association of Black Psychologists</a> (ABPsi) was formed as a national organization during the San Francisco meeting of the American Psychological Association (APA).<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;For a more complete history see, &lt;a href="references.html#ref-williamsHistoryAssociationBlack1974" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;Williams, R.

For example, the ABPsi adopted the following statement on testing:</p>
<p>"The Association of Black Psychologists fully supports those parents who have chosen to defend their rights by refusing to allow their children and themselves to be subjected to achievement, intelligence, aptitude and performance tests, which have been and are being used to:</p>

</h2>
<p>This textbook is aimed at providing an overview of research into cognition. One piece of that history involves psychologists who were advocates of the eugenics movement, who created tests of cognitive abilities with the purpose of applying those tests on society to further the aims of the eugenics movement. The role of eugenics in motivating the need to create tests of cognitive ability, and in spreading the use of those tests across society is not commonly discussed in introductory textbooks. However, the historical context raises important questions about how the enterprise of scientific research contributes to societies that fund it, and we should be mindful of these issues as we move onto other topics in cognition. For example, it is clear that psychologists researching human cognition can produce tools of questionable merit that become widely adopted in society, and that continue to have positive and negative outcomes for different groups of people in society.</p>
<p>The next chapter begins to transition back to more conventional areas in cognitive psychology, like the domains of learning and memory. We will continue to see many more examples of cognitive tasks that are very similar, if not essentially the same, as the mini-tests used as part of intelligence scales. However, rather than testing for the purpose of measuring and classifying a person, we will discuss examples where cognitive tasks are used to test theories and claims about how cognition works.</p>

A last issue to

The comparison to emwhich still occurs in all sort of modern aptitude testing, 


Initially, Binet's overall approach was very similar to Cattell's. He had three inventories of tests to measure psychological, pedagogical, and medical qualities of schoolchildren. 

Overall approach was similar to Cattell, had three inventories of tests, including psychological, pedagogical, and medical tests (similar to Cattell's tests).

Binet innovated over time, and honed in on the following basic tests.

how it worked
- different tests for each age group from 3 to 13. (1908), revised to include larger ranges (1911)
- The measurement strategy was to define "normal" in terms of age, with reference to an empirical distribution. 
- Binet assumed that children's mental abilities develop over time, and that mental abilities and general intelligence steadily increase year over year. He also invoked the ideas of averages. 


- cognitive psychology is a newer discipline compared to developmental psychology, social psych etc., but like those other branches of psychology, which have origins in eugenics, cognition has some too.


, and that a child's age in years 


- The procedures used by intelligence testers after Binet's test were popularized reflected elements of Cattell and Binet's ideas. Binet influenced how individual items on the test were created. They would be mentally challenging, tap different mental abilities, and be short enough to finish a whole test in 20 minutes. Cattell influenced how the tests would be validated, by examining whether performance on mental tests was correlated with outcomes in the real world.

#### Nature/Nurture

#### Translating Binet

- Binet calls for the need to develop consistent definitions and tests. Treatment of "subnormals" is already happening, and the lack of definitions and precise tests is problematic for anyone interested in determining whether the conditions can be improved. Progressive movements were also interested in mental testing. How would society attempt to ameliorate mental problems

Moron's are hard to tell from normal.

-The measure of mental age, "When our series, a portion of which we have given in this article, is completed, when instead of resting upon the exami- nation of only 10 or 15 subjects, it rests upon 100, we shall proceed by comparing the supposed subnormal with the average normal of each age, and we shall thus see to what average age he cor- responds for each kind of test." in Application of the New Methods to the Diagnosis of the In- tellectual Level among Normal and Subnormal Children in Institutions and in the

- false positives for instiutionalization, educational efficiencey, city of the future.

One test signifies nothing, let us emphatically repeat, but five or six tests signify something.

"And that is so true that one might almost say,
"It matters very little what the tests are so long as they are numerous."

- Nature nuture debate about hereditary components of intelligence (binet more tentative, eugenics proponents were usually strong hereditarians)...consequences for social policy were hanging in the balance. How should spending on schools be optimized? If some children are defective and incapable of learning, they shouldn't be given resources.

It is interesting to look at some of the people involved at the inception of long-standing institutions in american psychology, like the American Psychological Assocation (APA), and its original journal Psychological Review. The first two presidents of the APA, Granville Hall (1892) and George Ladd (1893) were eugenicists who founded (Hall) and co-edited (Ladd) the Journal of Race Development. The next president of the APA was James McKeen Cattell, also a prominent eugenicist. His psychological research at Columbia had failed to produce a useable intelligence test, and he transitioned into publishing. He founded Psychological Review for the APA, and he bought the journal Science, where he served as editor for 50 years. The first issue of psychological review features articles by the intellectual founder of eugenics (and other psychologist/eugencists), Sir Francis Galton, where he describes his uncanny ability to do arithmetic using smells [@galtonArithmeticSmell1894].

Both psychologists saw immense social utility in technology for mental testing that could improve society.

Although Binet is often credited with creating the first intelligence test, I'll say that he was the winner of the race to make such a test. There were several previous attempts to create tests of mental abilities. 

Psychologists in the eugenics movement since Galton, had been trying to develop intelligence for years. Remember, the eugenics movement strongly desired scientifically credible tests that could identify whether a person had inferior or superior intelligence. Lewis Terman was also a prominent eugenicist (member of the Human Betterment Foundation) and thought testing the mental abilities of schoolchildren would help isolate "defective" children from society (so they couldn't reproduce), and to identify gifted children who would be groomed into national leaders. Terman wrote of schoolchildren that, "it is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection of society. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency...The number of children with very superior ability is approximately as great as the number of feeble-minded. The future welfare of the country hinges, in no small degree, upon the right education of these superior children. "[@termanMeasurementIntelligenceExplanation1916].

This eugenics logic was applied to many different groups of people at the margins of society. The early 1900s had many social problems, and eugenics provided a kind of simple solution. The problem was probably genetic in nature, and could be bred out of existance using eugenics.

coordinated itself in public through large conferences and academic journals, and many notable people were involved. By 1923, 



Before we do that, let's consider some of the practical challenges that eugenics would have to deal with.

A big idea of eugenics was that the human race can be improved over generations through breeding. Imagine for the moment that a eugenics movement took over the entire world and began improving the human race through breeding processes. What kinds of issues would the movement need to negotiate in order to effectively pursue the eugenics agenda?

A major issue is what constitutes improvement? Who gets to decide what human qualities are desirable versus undesirable. Which qualities should be improved over generations of breeding, and which qualities should be removed? Galton and his adherents wrote volumes on this topic, and they claimed that human intelligence was one of the most important qualities of humans, and that human intelligence should and could be improved through breeding.

Another major set of issues was how to accomplish the task of breeding humans. For example, eugenics wouldn't work if people were left to their own devices to reproduce randomly with each other. Instead, two kinds of general eugenics policies were required to exert control over people and their mating behavior. Positive eugenics were methods for increasing reproduction between high quality people, and negative eugenics were methods for decreasing reproduction between low quality people. 

Testing was another issue. Eugenics needed to create reliable and scientifically accurate tests of human quality, such as intelligence tests. These would be needed to measure the quality of an individual person, and the results could then be used to encourage them (positive eugenics) or prevent them (negative eugenics) from reproducing in the future.

Scientific validity was another issue. A core claim of eugenics was that important human qualities like intelligence were biologically determined and hereditary; which made it possible (according to eugenics) to use breeding programs to alter qualities like intelligence over the generations. The whole idea that the human race could be improved through eugenics would seem to fall apart if the desirable parts of humans were not inherited, but instead learned.

-->
<!--for eugenics, the nature/nurture debate was about how much society could be improved through breeding programs, and then the leftover part was how much could be improved through training.

So, it would be necessary to provide evidence of the claim so that 

Other major issues were testing people to figure out which humans were good or bad quality in the first place. And, wouldn't breeding only work on hereditary qualities...so, does science know if these human qualities are actually inherited in the first place?

Let's assume for the moment that there were tests of different human qualities, like tests for intelligence

what does improvement mean? Improved from what to what? Eugenics had to make value judgments on which human qualities were desirable and thus potargets of improv



Here are basic tenets of eugenics. A major assumption is that individual differences in human quality are primarily determined by genetics. 



Galton was afraid that his society was about to deteriorate over time

that his society was in a very precarious position.


that, as a result of increasing global interactions between people of different "races",

This was well before the science of genetics clearly tossed out the biologic

To imagine the perspective of Galton, an esteemed upper-class British man of science (eventually knighted in 1909), the process of random natural selection had created relatively superior human beings compared to other animals; but, had not created all humans of equal quality. In particular, it was clear to Galton that people from "uncivilized" countries were of much lower quality than people from "civilized" countries. 



Superior superior parents have superior children. Inferior parents have inferior children. The human race could become supreme if it found a way to increase breeding between superior people, and decrease breeding between inferior people. Eugenics was the social engineering movement that would help society achieve the supreme human race over generations by controlling how people breed.

Perhaps a part of his work was to understand how psychological processes work, but it was also about service of the eugenics movement.

## Summer 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic Summer in Brooklyn)

Here's a bit of personal history. I spent the summer of 2020 mostly holed up in my Brooklyn apartment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wasn't teaching in the summer, so I was fortunate enough to be at home anyway. For a whole bunch of reasons I spent the whole summer learning about the eugenics movement and its connections with psychology. I was shocked at what I learned, and learning the history changed the way I think about psychology, and about cognitive psychology. Although some of the historical events are "shocking" because they are so terrible, I was also shocked and upset that my own education and time spent as a researcher had failed to make me aware of the history. I continue to think that psychology and its disciplines like cognitive psychology have many positive things to offer people and society. But, the legacy of eugenics shows that psychology and psychologists can produce research with dire consequences for humanity, that continue to this day, to reverberate throughout society.

## A brief history of psychology

How do people remember and understand history?

I used to have a rough sketch to summarize the history of psychology for myself. It went like this. Psychology was the general scientific discipline of the mind, and had grown out philosophy. There were a few early psychologists in the late 1800s who invented experimental methods for studying the mind. Academic interest in psychology spread quickly. Psychologists trained students, created psychology departments and research laboratories, and new journals to publish their findings. There were many different schools of thought about how psychology should proceed as a science. In the early 1900s some psychologists used introspection to examine their own minds. There were debates like the nature/nurture debate and the imageless thought debate. There was the dark ages of behaviorism in America, where only objective measures of stimuli and responses were allowed in psychology. Not everyone was a behaviorist the whole time, and eventually there was a "cognitive revolution" against behaviorism in the 1960s and 70s, and it became scientifically acceptable again to study how the mind works, even if cognitive processes are unobservable.

The above is not an accurate history of psychology. It is an example of how I loosely organized my understanding of the history. How people form and use beliefs about the world around them is an interesting aspect of cognition. Additionally, the process of changing beliefs given new information is
