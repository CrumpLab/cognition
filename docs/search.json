Experimental findings and proposed models will be discussed for each topic.\nCourse objectives: develop the following skills in relation to content learning objectives in 2530:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nLearning Outcome\n\n\n\n\n1. Exposure to breadth of theory and data across major domains of cognition (listed above)\nStudents will demonstrate ability to identify and describe domain-specific theories and phenomena\n\n\n2. Understanding deduction from theory, which requires an understanding of the assumptions of a theory and how they combine to force a clear prediction.\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to describe in written format the assumptions of a domain-specific theory along to show how the theory demands a prediction.\n\n\n3. Understanding experimental design\nStudents will demonstrate working knowledge of the elements of particular experimental designs that create opportunity to test a theoretical idea\n\n\n4. Understanding patterns in data\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to interpret tables and figures, including the pattern for how a dependent measure changes across the levels/conditions of the independent variable\n\n\n5. Understanding inference from results to theory\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to form an inference about an observed result, and display the ability to evaluate whether or not a result conforms to a prediction made by a theory in cognitive psychology"

Readings are freely available and posted on blackboard or the course website. Student are strongly encouraged to read assigned material before classes where the material is discussed.\nCLASS and WATCH/LISTEN: Modules usually involve two class meetings. Classes will involve a mixture of lectures and other activities. Note: a previous version of this course was taught asynchronously online which involved the creation of mini-lecture videos for each module. These videos will remain on the course website for students to use as supplemental resource. Slide decks used in the lecture will be posted on the course website.\nENGAGE: Modules include assignments for students to engage with course material. Assignments vary and there is flexibility for students to choose which assignments they complete."

    "text": "Assignments, Assessments, and Grading\nThere are multiple ways for students to engage with course materials and achieve their desired grade. Students are encouraged to choose the assignments that work best for them. Major course assessments that occur throughout the semester are designed to help students set and achieve their own goals for engaging in course content.\n\nAssignments\nEach weekly module will contain two or more assignment opportunities. In general, quizzes are worth 2.5 points and other assignments are worth 5 points. Students are strongly encouraged to complete at least one assignment per module. Students can complete as many quizzes or assignments as they want, for a maximum of 75 points toward their final grade.\nIn collaboration with the instructor, students follow a process of self-assessment to recommend how many points should be awarded for their own assignments (not including quizzes). The self-assessment process is used as a guide toward goal setting and achievement in the course.\nIn addition to the weekly assignments, which focus on the details of module content, there are opportunities to complete more general assignments. These are listed on their own tab within blackboard.\n\n\nDiscussion Boards\nThere will be opportunity to gain points through participation in discussion boards on Blackboard. See instructions on blackboard for individual discussion boards.\n\n\nAssessments\nThere are three major assessments throughout the semester culminating in a final assessment conducted during final exam week. These assessments are used as an aid toward goal-setting and achievement in the course. The first two assessments focus on goal-setting and goal refinement with respect to engaging in course material. The final assessment focuses on goal-achievement, and feedback with respect to engaging in course material. Unless otherwise stated all major course assessments are conducted in person during regular class time (or during the scheduled final exam period).

You may be able to work ahead, but you are not encouraged to fall behind.\nYou should email me if you have an exceptional circumstance preventing you from taking an assessment during an assessment week.\n\n\nChanges to the syllabus\nThe syllabus may be updated for clarity or to make adjustments for pedagogical purposes. The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nIndividual versus group work\nThe default assumption is that all assigned work is individual work. Therefore, you should complete all coursework by yourself. Make sure you understand the University’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below. Any assignment that is not an individual assignment will be clearly labeled.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nEmail Correspondence\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.\nIf you have questions please email me:\n\nput PSYC 2530 in your subject line\nemail me at: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office."

    "text": "Honors project for PSYC 2530: An experiment proposal\nThe honors project for PSYC 2530 is a written experiment proposal. The purpose of the project is to propose an experiment capable of testing the predictions of an existing explanation or theory of a cognitive phenomena. This project is an opportunity to engage with scientific thinking in the domain of cognition.\nMore information is provided below.\n\nApproval\nStudents interested in completing the honors project need to seek approval from the instructor. Please email Matt Crump to express your interest and seek approval for your project.\nPlease read the conceptual requirements of the project listed below. This provides a set of instructions and expectations for the project.\nTo get approval for the honors project you will have to identify:\n\nThe cognitive phenomena that you will be investigating with your experiment proposal\nThe theory of the cognitive phenomena that you will be testing with your proposal\nA citation or pdf to a cognitive psychology research article that shows the cognitive phenomena, and gives an example of the theory being tested.\n\n\n\nDue Date\nThe honors project is due at the end of the final exam period. Submit your proposal on blackboard.\n\n\nProposal Length and Formatting Expectations\nThe minimum length is five double-spaced pages for the main body of the paper, not including title page, abstract, and references. The paper should be in APA style (see example paper at the end).\n\n\nConceptual Requirements\nResearch in cognition involves investigations of particular cognitive abilities. Researchers propose theories about how cognitive abilities work, and then they design experiments to test the predictions of the theories.\nThis proposal requires the following conceptual components. These should be clearly identifiable in your paper.\n\nIdentify a cognitive phenomena: your proposal must test explanations of an existing cognitive phenomena that has been described in the cognition literature.\n\n\nEstablish what phenomena you are discussing at the beginning\nGive examples of the phenomena from the literature\nCite your examples.\n\n\nDescribe a testable theory of the phenomena: your proposal will test an existing theoretical explanation of the cognitive phenomena you choose.\n\n\nIdentify the theory, with citations\nExplain how the theory works, along with how it has been used to explain aspects of the cognitive phenomena.\n\n\nDevelop testable theoretical implications/predictions: your proposal will describe an experiment that puts the theoretical explanation to the test. In order to do this, you need to consider the kinds of predictions that the theory does and does not make. What does the theory suggest would happen to the cognitive phenomena in scenario X? What does the theory suggest would happen in scenario Y? You should consider predictions that can be tested with scenarios you create with your experiment.\n\n\nDescribe the testable predictions or implications of theory\nNote: these are the predictions that you will be proposing to test with your experiment.\n\n\nPropose an experimental manipulation to test the theoretical prediction: Your proposal will describe an experimental manipulation to test the predictions of the theory.\n\n\nThis is a mini methods section\nDescribe your proposed methods, which should involve your proposed manipulation and your proposed measurement\n\n\nMake theoretical inferences about possible results: This is where you describe possible results that could occur from your experiment, and how these results would relate to your theoretical predictions.\n\n\nIf the theoretical predictions from above are true, then what data pattern would be expected in your experiment? Make sure you describe what pattern of data would be expected given the theoretical predictions\nIf the theoretical predictions are not true, then what data pattern would you expect to find? Make sure you also describe the kind of data pattern that would show the theoretical predictions to be incorrect\n\n\nCorroborate or Falsify?: Your experiment proposal could be intended to corroborate the predictions of a theory, or to falsify predictions of a theory. Make sure you clarify what your proposal is aiming towards.\n\n\nCorroborating: You should identify a prediction or implication from the theory that suggests a particular data pattern should be observed under the conditions of your proposed experiment. If you ran the experiment, and the data pattern was found to be the same as the pattern predicted by the theory, then your data would corroborate the theoretical prediction. (note: corroborating means “confirm or give support to”, and if the data pattern fits then it confirms the prediction.)\nFalsifying: Your experiment be intended to invalidate a theoretical prediction. For example, the theory could predict that a particular data pattern ought to occur in your experimental conditions; but, you may be interested in showing that the theoretically predicted pattern DOES NOT occur. If the pattern predicted by the theory does not occur, then your experiment may provide a means to disconfirm or falsify the theory.\nIf you want to have extra fun, then come up with multiple experiment proposals. For example, create one proposal that should corroborate the predictions of the theory, and another experiment proposal to falsify the predictions of the theory."

G. (1987). Repetition blindness: Type recognition without token individuation. Cognition, 27(2), 117–143. https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(87)90016-3\n\n\n\n\nGetting approval\nI will communicate with you over email to let you know if you are approved to go ahead with the honors project. The goal of the approval process is to make sure you have identified a cognitive phenomena and a theory from the literature that you can test in your proposal.\n\n\nExample proposal\nThe next step is to write your proposal. To provide an example of what I am looking for I wrote a sample honors project that meets the conceptual requirements above.\nYou can download the example here.\n\n\nSubmitting your honors project\nWhen you have completed your honors project, submit it on blackboard. Congrats!"

This assignment is worth 5 points.\nExample:\nTo give an example, the following could appear as a short answer question on an exam testing content in the memory I chapter.\nQuestion: How does the multi-store model (Atkinson and Shiffrin) explain the recency effect, and why is it unable to explain the long-term recency effect?\nAnswer: The multi-store model uses a short-term rehearsal buffer to explain the recency effect. The recency effect is the finding that words at the end of a list are typically recalled better than words in the middle of the list. According to the model, the words at the end of list are being actively rehearsed in the short-term rehearsal buffer. As result, all of the words in the buffer are available when participants recall the words. Specifically, during the recall phase, participants may simply write down the words they are rehearsing. As a result, recall memory is higher for the words at the end of the list (which are in the buffer and recalled immediately), compared to words in the middle of the list, which are likely not in the rehearsal buffer. The long-term recency effect occurs when a long delay intervenes between the encoding phase and recall phase. Over this period of time it is likely that any short-term rehearsal buffer no longer contains any words from the encoding phase (i.e., participants stop actively rehearsing words). Nevertheless, the long-term recency effect shows better recall memory for words at the end of a list compared to words from the middle of the list. This finding is not well explained by the concept of a short-term rehearsal process, because people are assumed to have ceased rehearsing well-before the final recall test."

There are many things that you could do to engage yourself with the field of cognitive psychology. Importantly, you won’t get credit for being a person with cognition. For example, if you say that you had thoughts in your head yesterday, and that involves cognition, I won’t give you points. But, if you said you wondered about your inner voice and how that works, so you read a paper from the literature on the cognition of inner voice processes, and then summarized what you read in a short abstract so that you could remember the article…that would count for course credit."

Then, move on to the next learning module.\n\nParticipate in a short Stroop experiment\n5 points\nThis assignment involves participating in an online Stroop experiment, and relating your own results to the predictions described in lecture.\nThe last part of the lecture describes a Stroop experiment designed to test whether people can deliberately control their attention toward word information. This involves performing the Stroop task while deliberately ignoring word information or deliberately focusing on word information.\nYour assignment has two parts:\n\nTry the Stroop experiment yourself and record your results that are displayed at the end of the experiment. The experiment takes about 5 minutes and can be completed through your browser (you need a keyboard).\n\nhttps://experiments.crumplab.com/publix/3/start?batchId=32&generalMultiple\nImportant: Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous. If you agree to participate and complete the experiment, then your anonymous data will be recorded and analyzed. Although this is mainly a classroom demo, it is possible that the results could be useful to the scientific community, and they may be shared or published in the future.\n\nDescribe the predictions for performance in this task from lecture, and then report whether or not your own data followed the predicted pattern. Specifically, describe whether or not you found a bigger or smaller Stroop effect when you were ignoring the words compared to when you were focusing on the words.\n\n\n\nBrainstorm a Stroop Experiment\nThis assignment does not involved participation in a Stroop experiment, but it does involve brainstorming a new manipulation capable of changing the size of the Stroop effect. Your proposed manipulation should be different from the one described in the lecture.\nYour assignment has three components.\n\nPropose an experimental manipulation with two groups or conditions. One group or condition should cause the color-word Stroop effect to become smaller, and the other group or condition should cause the color-word Stroop effect to become larger. Describe your manipulation for each group/condition\nExplain why you think the manipulation would cause an increase or decrease in the Stroop effect for each group/condition.\nCreate a graph of the predicted results for your proposed manipulation. This graph should show predicted means for congruent and incongruent items in both groups, and it should correctly show which group/condition you expect to have an increased Stroop effect, and which group you expect to show a decreased Stroop effect.\n\nThis assignment is worth 5 points."

Then, move on to the next learning module.\n\nDescribe a curious language phenomena or experience\n5 points\nThis is a short writing assignment for you to describe any curious or interesting language phenomena that you may have experienced. This is an open-ended prompt for you to reflect on your own language experiences and then describe why it is interesting and what it might tell us about how language processes work.\nHere are some example topics. Have you ever accidentally said a word you didn’t mean to say? Have you temporarily forgotten a word that you know you know? Are you really good at saying words really fast? Have you had trouble learning new words? Have you ever thought you knew the meaning of a word, but later found out that the word didn’t mean what you thought it meant?\nAny of those examples and more would be suitable for the assignment. Discuss the example, then consider what you think the experience might mean for the cognitive processes involved in language.\nMinimum 150 words."

Then, move on to the next learning module.\n\nApply a cognitive bias to real life\nThere are many known cognitive biases that may influence how people make judgments and decisions. This wikipedia list provides a fairly comprehensive list of known biases :\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\n\nPick any cognitive bias from the above list\nProvide a brief definition/example of the cognitive bias that you chose\nGenerate two real-world scenarios where you would expect the cognitive bias to influence a person’s judgment and decision-making process.\n\nHere is an example of a completed assignment, but you will have to use a different cognitive bias.\nAnchoring bias\nDefinition: The anchoring bias occurs when judgments are biased toward a salient and potentially arbitrary stimulus that serves as the anchor. For example, a small number could be presented as an anchor, and later judgments about quantities could be biased toward smaller numbers because the anchoring stimulus was a small number.\nReal-world Example 1: A used car lot lists the sale prices of cars as much higher than they are worth. These prices serve as anchors, and they may bias potential buyers to make offers that are closer to the anchor value (higher than the car is worth), compared to the real value of the car.\nReal-world Example 2: The first dish you taste at a new restaurant was way too salty. As you taste other dishes you are biased to judge them as over-salted as well."

The phenomena show examples of factors that can improve and/or interfere with memory. For example, making information meaningful can improve memory for the information. The principles describe guiding ideas that impact memory performance. For example, context cues can help memory, but only when the contexts are meaningfully processed during encoding (the encoding specificity principles).\nIn at least 250 words, your assignment is to describe how you could apply these phenomena and principles to improve your personal study habits for learning and retaining new information in general. Try to include or consider how you could include as many of the phenomena/principles as possible.\nExample: You could try to answer the following kinds of questions:\nHow could a spacing manipulation improve my study habits? How could the time spent studying improve my study habits? How could context-effects improve my study habits? How could the levels of processing principle improve myt study habits? etc."

    "text": "What is cognition and how does it work? The book is titled “Instances of Cognition” to orient you to the diversity of ideas, approaches, and multi-faceted interests in this field of research. As a side note, later in the course we will discuss theories of how cognition works that are called “instance theories” (Jamieson et al., 2022, readcube link to read the paper online https://rdcu.be/cGGzW). Despite centuries of research into cognition and the wealth of knowledge generated from that work, there remain many unresolved issues and divergent perspectives that have not yet produced widely accepted answers to fundamental questions about the nature and mechanics of cognition.\nThe diversity of approaches and perspectives in cognition make it difficult to coherently survey the entire field in a textbook. So, this textbook adopts a museum metaphor to help structure the overview. Consider the task of learning about everything in a museum like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It’s an impossible task. The MET is way too big to see in one day. It has many rooms with countless artifacts, each with their own histories. A tour guide takes you on a path through the museum while providing context and background and highlighting interesting tidbits. However, a comprehensive understanding of the story behind a single artifact could require years or lifetimes of careful investigation.\nCognition is like the museum. It contains many artifacts in the form of questions, methods, findings, theories, applications, and implications for society. This textbook is like a museum tour guide. It is intended to highlight different domains in cognition, and hopefully find ways to tell compelling stories along the way. Like the MET is open to the public, much of the research we will discuss is open to you, in the form of published journal articles and books."

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 What is mental imagery?\nMental imagery is the subjective experience of being in your own mind, particularly when using your imagination. Can you envision a picture, scene, or movie in your “mind’s eye”? If so, how would you describe the quality of the mental image? Is it vivid and lifelike? If not, what is your experience when using your imagination?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental imagery\n\n\n\nImagined sensations of any type, including seeing pictures in your mind’s eye, hearing a song in your head, using your inner voice, and others like imagined smell, touch, or a sense of space.\n\n\nWhen I close my eyes, I have limited visualization ability. I can imagine visual scenes, especially familiar places like my kitchen. My imagery seems to be more spatial than visual, as I can feel the layout of the scene more easily than seeing visual features of the mental picture. Occasionally, my mental imagery is vivid and lifelike, particularly in dreams that can appear just as compelling as real life. So, according to me, my mental imagery ranges from fairly fuzzy to occasionally extremely vivid and lifelike.\nThe next section reviews evidence that people report a wide range of mental imagery abilities. For example, some people report the ability to effortlessly visualize extremely clear and vivid lifelike images. Some people report medium visualizing ability, whereas others report having very little to no mental imagery.\n\n\n2.2 Generating facts about mental imagery\nAnswering questions about mental imagery requires establishing facts about the phenomena that we can trust and collectively agree upon. However, the subjective aspects of mental imagery present difficulties for objectively measurement. Nevertheless, the literature contains methods and findings relevant to mental imagery phenomena, and because of the subjective nature of the topic, some skepticism is required for evaluating research results. We begin with the method of introspection.\n\n2.2.1 Methods of Introspection and Subjective report\nThe method of introspection involves self-reflection upon or scrutinizing aspects of your own cognition. For example, I used introspection to think about my own mental imagery experience in the previous section. Similarly, I used the method of subjective report to describe my experiences using a short paragraph. As a historical side note, introspection was used as a technique to generate knowledge about the mind by early German psychologist Wilhem Wundt (1832-1920) and American psychologist Edward Titchener (1867-1927) who developed the structuralism school of psychology. Methods of subjective report remain very common today, often in the form of questionnaires that ask people to make various subjective judgments. Before considering the limitations of introspection and subjective report, let’s see a concrete example from the beginning of mental imagery research.\n\n\n2.2.2 Galton’s Statistics of mental imagery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)\n\n\n\nSir Francis Galton (1822-1911) was a British psychologist who was one of the first to systematically study mental imagery. To quote from his 1880 paper titled, Statistics of mental imagery (Galton, 1880), Galton set out to:\n\n“define the different degrees of vividness with which different persons have the faculty of recalling familiar scenes under the form of mental pictures, and the peculiarities of the mental visions of different persons” .\n\nThe next section reviews Galton’s methods and major findings. His original manuscript is freely available from archive.org.\n\n2.2.2.1 Galton’s Method of Subjective Report\nGalton devised the “Breakfast Table Task” which involved a series of structured questions about mental imagery. He sent letters to 100 people asking them to reply with answers to his questions. The questions are reprinted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGalton’s Breakfast table task questions:\n\n\n\n“Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the opposite page, think of some definite object – suppose it is your breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning – and consider carefully the picture that rises before your mind’s eye. [p. 302]\n\nIllumination. – Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its brightness comparable to that of the actual scene ?\nDefinition. – Are all the objects pretty well defined at the same time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment more contracted than it is in a real scene?\nColouring. – Are the colours of the china, of the toast, bread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table, quite distinct and natural?”\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Galton’s results\nHere are some of the answers from “100 men, at least half of whom are distinguished in science or in other fields of intellectual work.” (reprinted from his original manuscript):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is very high\n\n\n\n\nBrilliant, distinct, never blotchy.\nQuite comparable to the real object. I feel as though I was dazzled, e.g., when recalling the sun to my mental vision.\nIn some instances quite as bright as an actual scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is mediocre\n\n\n\n\nFairly clear and not incomparable in illumination with that of the real scene, especially when I first catch it. Apt to become fainter when more particularly attended to.\nFairly clear, not quite comparable to that of the actual scene. Some objects are more sharply defined than others, the more familiar objects coming more distinctly in my mind.\nFairly clear as a general image; details rather misty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases where the faculty is at the lowest\n\n\n\n\nDim and indistinct, yet I can give an account of this morning’s breakfast table; – split herrings, broiled chickens, bacon, rolls, rather light coloured marmalade, faint green plates with stiff pink flowers, the girls’ dresses, &c., &c. I can also tell where all the dishes were, and where the people sat (I was on a visit). But my imagination is seldom pictorial except between sleeping and waking, when I sometimes see rather vivid forms.\nI am very rarely able to recall any object whatever with any sort of distinctness. Very occasionally an object or image will recall itself, but even then it is more like a generalised image than an individual image. I seem to be almost destitute of visualising power, as under control.\nMy powers are zero. To my consciousness there is almost no association of memory with objective visual impressions. I recollect the breakfast table, but do not see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Galton’s conclusion\nGalton’s major conclusion and potential discovery was evidence for a wide variety of individual differences in mental imagery. Some people reported having very strong powers of mental visualization, while others reported having moderate abilities, and still, others reported having no abilities to visualize anything in their mind’s eye at all.\nIf Galton’s results provide reliable facts, then explaining mental imagery becomes more challenging. Not only do we need to explain how individuals create mental images, but we also need to account for why some individuals can vividly create these images while others cannot. This illustrates the growing complexity that follows the research cycle. Every question answered leads to new facts, which in turn result in new questions requiring thorough explanation.\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Limitations with Galton’s method\nGalton’s methods were straightforward. He wanted to know how different people experienced mental imagery, so he asked them to think about it and tell him. Although introspection and subjective report were good starting points they also have shortcomings that could invalidate the results. Consider the following limitations: Galton’s participants could have lied about their mental imagery. Their statements could reflect fictional stories rather than facts about mental imagery abilities. The participants may have inaccurately described their own experiences. For example, descriptions could be exaggerated or contain mistaken impressions. People may use different words that suggest larger differences in mental imagery than actually exist.\nEstablishing facts about mental imagery is challenging because the subjective experience of a person’s own mental imagery cannot be directly observed by others. In other fields of study, direct observation can help to establish a collective set of agreed-upon facts. For instance, a group of geologists can all observe and point to a rock formation, concur that it exists, and then analyze and measure it to gather additional directly observable information. Galton’s subjective report technique does include some observable measurements, such as the words utilized by people to depict their mental imagery. However, people’s verbal responses are an indirect attempt to communicate an experience and do not supply an objective perspective that other observers can use to witness the experience itself.\nObtaining objective facts about subjective experience is undoubtedly a challenge, but there are tools developed since Galton’s to help make progress on these issues. One common requirement for establishing facts is to show that they are reproducible. In psychological research, a reproducible finding is one that reliably occurs when an exact or conceptually similar study is repeated by other researchers. The next section examines the reproducibility of Galton’s core claims and findings.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Reproducing Galton’s mental imagery work\nGalton conducted his work in the United Kingdom throughout the last half of the 1800s, and like some of his other ideas (that we will discuss in the next chapter), they spread among psychologists in other countries. At the turn of the century, American psychologists were busy using Galton’s methods and publishing on the mental imagery abilities of college students. For example, in 1896, Armstrong (1894) gave the “Breakfast Table Task” to students at Wesleyan University (a male college). The general pattern of results was similar to what Galton found. The students reported a wide range of mental imagery abilities, including a small proportion of students who were classified as having little to no visual imagery.\nIn 1902, French (1902) asked students at Vassar College (a women’s college) about their mental imagery abilities using a longer mental imagery questionnaire created by Titchener (1905), that was intended to improve upon Galton’s original questions. The results were mostly consistent with prior findings: the Vassar students reported a wide range of mental imagery abilities. However, one finding was not replicated: all 118 students reported having mental imagery abilities, and none claimed to have none. This could mean that all of the students happened to possess mental imagery abilities, or it could raise doubts about the claim that some people do not have mental imagery. One possibility is that the results depend on the questionnaire used. Galton had 10 questions on mental imagery, while Titchener had almost 90 questions that extended to other senses, and which could have given students additional opportunities to admit that they had at least some mental imagery. Perhaps, if Galton and Armstrong had used Titchener’s new questionnaire, they too might have found all of their participants reporting at least some mental imagery ability.\n\n\n2.2.4 Aphantasia and Hyperphantasia\nLet’s skip over a century and ask what recent research on mental imagery looks like. In 2010, Zeman and colleagues reported a case of a patient with “imagery generation disorder” (A. Z. Zeman et al., 2010) that was picked up by the media. Several people who heard about the finding contacted the researchers to let them know that they also did not experience visual imagery. This led the research group to begin examining these claims in more detail and in 2015 (A. Zeman et al., 2015), they did something very similar to what Galton did; namely, ask people questions about the vividness of their mental imagery. They used a newer questionnaire developed to assess the vividness of visual imagery (Marks, 1973) and gave it to the people who claimed they had no visual imagery. Perhaps not surprisingly, those same people gave answers to the questionnaire that were consistent with their claims that they had visual imagery. Zeman coined the term (aphantasia)[#gls-aphantasia] to describe the condition of having little to no mental imagery.\nThe media attention to Zeman’s work on aphantasia caused a great deal of interest across the world. One of the research participants in the 2015 study created the Aphantasia Network website, which has grown into a large online community for people with aphantasia. By 2020 (A. Zeman et al., 2020), Zeman’s group had been contacted by 14,000 people who claimed they either had aphantasia, or the opposite – extremely vivid and life-like mental imagery, termed hyperphantasia. Some of the claims are quite extraordinary. For example, in a 2021 New York Times article (Zimmer, 2021), cognitive neuroscientist Joel Pearson claimed that ‘hyperphantasia could go far beyond just having an active imagination…and that “People [with hyperphantasia] watch a movie, and then they can watch it again in their mind, and it’s indistinguishable.”’.\nI can’t accurately replay a whole movie in my head: that is pretty incredible. To me, this claim is so incredible that I wonder if the person was exaggerating their ability a little. Although I am skeptical, there is no shortage of people accomplishing astounding, and objectively verifiable feats of cognition. Daniel Tammet (“Daniel Tammet,” 2021) is famous for breaking the European record for correctly reciting from memory the first 22,514 digits of the number pi. So, if Daniel Tammet can accurately “replay” the digits of pi for five hours, maybe someone else can replay a whole movie in their mind. Again, the role of direct observation comes into play for lending support to an extraordinary claim. The fact that Daniel could say the digits of pi out loud for other observers to hear, under controlled conditions (where those observers could verify he wasn’t cheating somehow), makes it easier to believe that Daniel’s ability is real. Similarly, if there were more direct methods to test claims about extreme differences in mental imagery abilities, this would lend more support to those extraordinary claims.\n\n\n2.2.5 Taking stock of the facts so far\nWe have just surveyed a few examples of research into mental imagery abilities. These examples were chosen to highlight some of the challenges with establishing facts about cognitive abilities. I deliberately chose a tough example like mental imagery, where it is inherently difficult to obtain clear, objective facts that everyone can agree upon. Therefore, before we consider an example of theorizing about mental imagery and the larger task of explaining how an ability like mental imagery works, let’s consider the kinds of facts we have so far and the role they play in the research cycle.\nI consider the work reviewed so far as preliminary exploratory research that was on a fact-finding mission. From Galton to Zeman, the questionnaires have been developed to ask “what” questions, rather than “how” questions. Of course, it is useful to establish facts about “what mental imagery is like” before developing and testing theories about “how mental imagery works”.\nWhat facts about mental imagery can we say have been established by the research? First, reasonable people can have different answers to this question, which adds complexity to explaining cognitive abilities like mental imagery. To give my perspective, I’ll list a few questions about mental imagery, and discuss what kind of evidence we have for the facts.\nIs mental imagery a real cognitive ability? Are there individual differences in mental imagery abilities? Do some people really have zero mental imagery abilities? Do some people have truly lifelike mental imagery?\nThe research we reviewed all used introspection and subjective report methods (questionnaires) to ask people questions about their own subjective experiences of mental imagery. These methods have limitations, as we discussed previously. People might be lying, inaccurate, inattentive, unable to describe their own experience or describe similar experiences differently. As a consequence, the quality of the results is limited by the quality of the measurement tool. We cannot claim that the questionnaire data provides clear, objective facts about a person’s internal subjective experience of mental imagery. However, we can agree that the research has produced some objective facts about how people describe their own mental imagery. Across centuries and thousands of participants, people consistently claim that mental imagery is real to them, and similar proportions of people consistently claim that they have different kinds of mental imagery abilities. So, if you were to make your own questionnaire to ask random people on the street about their mental imagery abilities, what do you think would happen given the existing research we discussed? My prediction would be that you would find the same kinds of results that Galton did in 1880 and Zeman did in the 2010s.\nSome takeaways from reviewing this literature are clear: asking people about their own experience proves useful, as they usually make consistent claims about mental imagery and provide subjective evidence of its features. Despite this, there are limitations posed by subjective reports, thus suggesting the need for alternative tools to more objectively measure different aspects of mental imagery.\n\n\n\n2.3 Theories, explanation and mental imagery\nThe cognitive sciences are not only concerned with discovering the facts about cognitive abilities such as mental imagery, but are also interested in explaining how these abilities work. Explanations can take different forms, and throughout the textbook we will encounter relatively simple claims about how something might work, as well as well-developed verbal theories and highly specified computer simulations proposing working algorithms for specific cognitive abilities. Throughout, I will encourage us to keep wondering about what kind of explanation would be satisfying when trying to explain how different cognitive abilities work.\nCurrently, there is no widely accepted theory explaining how mental imagery works. As we previously mentioned, even the features of mental imagery lack a strong consensus, which is why the absence of a theory is not unexpected. However, there has been considerable theoretical debate concerning mental imagery, which offers a valuable example of how theories and explanations are used in cognitive research.\n\n2.3.1 Mental Imagery as explanation\nIn the previous section, I discussed the omission of approximately one hundred years of research in mental imagery. During this period, there were general movements in psychology that influenced how researchers posed questions about it. Gradual transitions occurred between different schools of thought that affected inquiry methods. At the beginning of psychology in the USA, Titchener (1867-1927) developed Structuralism. This school of thought utilized introspection techniques to carefully, albeit subjectively, investigate and distinguish individual components of cognitive processes. In contrast, Behaviorism emphasized asking questions that only objective measures of behavior could answer. Some “hard-core” behaviorists, such as B.F. Skinner (1904-1990), argued that psychology should only study observable phenomena like behavior, and internal processes of the mind should not be subject to scientific inquiry. As a result, research on topics like mental imagery received little attention from most behaviorists. However, in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, there was a “cognitive revolution” of sorts, and more psychologists returned to asking questions about cognitive abilities, including mental imagery.\nWhen mental imagery resurfaced as a research topic, it presented itself as a potential explanation for other cognitive abilities. In the 1960s, there was a substantial amount of literature on human memory abilities, which was focused on evaluating the factors that impact how well people can remember verbal stimuli like words. In 1963, Allan Paivio (1963) entertained the idea that mental imagery could play a role in tasks where individuals attempt to recollect words from a list. He proposed that having a vivid mental image when reading a word could enhance the likelihood of remembering it later. Conversely, other words that did not evoke such strong mental imagery could be more challenging to recall later. Paivio also conducted some experimental research that corroborated the notion that mental imagery is integral to memory abilities.\n\n\n2.3.2 Paivio’s concrete versus abstract memory task\nPaivio conducted a paired-associate learning task which involved running experiments on both elementary and college students. The results obtained from both groups were similar. If you were a participant in the experiment, here’s what occurred.\nParticipants in the experiment were given pairs of words to remember for a memory test. The word pairs consisted of an adjective and a noun, such as “Ingenious-Inventor”. It’s important to note that there were two types of word pairs: those with a concrete noun and those with an abstract noun. This difference in noun type was a critical aspect of the experiment’s manipulation. Below are some examples of the two types of word pairs.\n\n\n\nConcrete pairs\nAbstract Pairs\n\n\n\n\nIngenious-Inventor\nIngenious-Interpretation\n\n\nTechnical-Advertisement\nTechnical-Discourse\n\n\nMassive-Granite\nMassive-Rebellion\n\n\nSubtle-Magician\nSubtle-Prejudice\n\n\nProfound-Philosopher\nProfound-Analysis\n\n\nRugged-Arctic\nRugged-Locality\n\n\nShabby-Hermit\nShabby-Client\n\n\nClumsy-Burglar\nClumsy-Imitation\n\n\nUnpleasant-Bruise\nUnpleasant-Scandal\n\n\nSensitive-Lungs\nSensitive-Tissue\n\n\nColourful-Maple\nColourful-Scenery\n\n\nReliable-Luggage\nReliable-Merchandize\n\n\nExpressive-Actress\nExpressive-Temperament\n\n\nAmazing-Circus\nAmazing-Crusade\n\n\nNoisy-Trumpet\nNoisy-Gossip\n\n\nFashionable-Overcoat\nFashionable-Apparel\n\n\n\nWhat makes a noun more concrete or abstract? The general idea was that concrete words are potentially more evocative, meaningful, and easier to mentally image than abstract words. For example, hearing or reading the word “Magician” might cause you to think of a colorful magician’s hat, whereas the word “Discourse” might not bring to mind specific mental images. Paivio chose the words that he considered more concrete and more abstract when constructing the lists for his experiment. As a caveat, it is totally possible that one person might find a specific word more concrete, and another person would experience the same word as more abstract.\nDuring the encoding phase, the experimenter read lists of 16 word pairs out loud, with a two-second pause in between. Half of the word pairs had a concrete noun, and the other half had an abstract noun. During the memory test, the experimenter read out only the first word from each pair (the adjective), and participants were asked to remember the word it was paired with and write it down. If you heard the word “Amazing” and you were given the concrete pair, then the correct answer would be to write down “Circus”. If you were given the abstract pair, then the correct answer would be “Crusade”.\nPaivio’s study examined whether people remember concrete nouns better than abstract nouns. The study’s empirical question was answered as Paivio found that this was indeed the case. In the second experiment, participants correctly recalled 4.5 concrete nouns on average, while they only recalled 2 abstract nouns correctly. Although the difference was only 2.5 words, the results were consistent across 120 university students. These findings suggest that the concrete or abstract quality of words can impact memory performance.\n\n2.3.2.1 Paivio’s explanations\nPaivio entertained different explanations of his results, and the way he related results to explanations is fairly common in cognitive psychology. In the introduction of his paper he referred to new ideas about how memory might work from Miller, Galanter, & Pribram (1960), who suggested that mental imagery could help people efficiently organize, store, and then later retrieve information in memory. And, he raised the possibility that mental imagery was the reason why participants remembered concrete (more image-able) better than abstract nouns (less image-able). Let’s call this the mental imagery explanation.\nHowever, Paivio also considered that the “concept of mediating imagery…may be unnecessary” to explain his results. He proposed an alternative explanation: that memory performance was determined by pre-existing associations between the word pairs. Some words are more likely to follow others, and individuals may have developed different associations between various words. For instance, an individual may have a stronger association between “Noisy-Trumpet” (a concrete pair) compared to “Noisy-Gossip” (an abstract pair). In an experiment, if given the cue word “Noisy”, the individual may remember “Trumpet” more efficiently, not because they formed a mental image of a trumpet, but because the association between “Noisy” and “Trumpet” already existed. This is referred to as the pre-existing association explanation.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 The research cycle and theory testing\nPaivio’s paper concludes with a proposal for an experiment to further test the two explanations for the experiment’s results: mental imagery versus pre-existing association. This example highlights the cognitive research cycle in which questions are refined from one experiment to the next. One important aspect is having multiple speculative explanations that make different, testable predictions. The second ingredient is researchers’ creativity in designing a new experiment capable of testing these predictions.\nConsider the scenario where a drug could instantly disable all mental imagery of individuals. In this scenario, if mental imagery plays a key role in helping people to remember concrete nouns more effectively than abstract nouns, then repeating the same experiment with individuals under the influence of the drug should result in a different outcome for memory. Specifically, we would expect the prior difference in memory performance between concrete and abstract words to disappear. This is because the drug would essentially nullify mental imagery, which would render it incapable of causing variation in memory performance between the two types of words. If, despite this factor, memory performance still displayed significant differences, it would discredit the mental imagery explanation.\nPaivio didn’t have a magic wand to make mental imagery turn off, so he proposed a different approach to control for aspects of pre-existing associations’ influence. He suggested a new experiment be conducted using random pairings of adjectives and concrete or abstract nouns. This could prevent biased results as, for instance, the adjective ‘noisy’ might already have a meaningful association with the noun ‘trumpet’, and therefore carry bias. If the advantage for remembering concrete nouns over abstract nouns persisted under these new control conditions, it would be evidence that pre-existing associations do not explain Paivio’s findings. Thus, the concept of ‘mediating imagery’ may become necessary to explain the influence of memory for words.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Theories of Mental Representation\nBefore evaluating the kinds of explanations of cognitive abilities we have seen so far, let’s do one more example from the literature. Throughout the 60s and 70s, there were many other studies like Paivio’s that invoked the concept of mental imagery as potentially necessary to explain how people were performing different kinds of tasks. In 1973, Zenon Pylyshyn (1973) published a critique of these emerging mental imagery explanations, and initiated a lengthy debate with Stephen Kosslyn about the format of mental representations. This debate led to a number of experiments attempting to provide evidence in favor and/or against either position.\nI will use the terms “pictorial” versus “propositional” to distinguish between the two theoretical ideas about mental representations. The idea of pictorial representation suggests that perceptual and mental imagery experiences are represented in a similar format, implying that perception may be involved in mental imagery and that mental imagery may behave similarly to perception in certain conditions. The concept of “pictorial representation” evokes the idea of perceiving and imagining an image relying on similar mental representations.\nAccording to the propositional representation assumption, mental representations are fundamentally different from our perceptual experiences. To better illustrate this idea, consider the example of using words to describe an image. When we write a paragraph to describe an image, we employ word symbols and rules for combining words together to form sentences. The result is a written description of an image that is distinct from the image itself. Thus, it’s clear that words and sentences used to describe an image produce a wholly different kind of representation than the image itself. On this view, people don’t actually have pictures in their minds; instead, cognitive abilities are controlled by propositional knowledge and representation systems.\nThe idea of cognitive representation can include two contrasting perspectives: the pictorial and propositional. How do we perceive our experiences of the world - through picture-like or perception-like representations? Do these representations instead operate on abstract and distinct propositional codes? To explore the possibilities, let’s examine an experiment using mental chronometry. What implications do the results of this experiment have for the two differing views of mental representation? Can their predictions be tested using further experiments?\n\n2.3.3.1 Mental Chronometry\nIn 1978, Stephen Kosslyn and colleagues (1978) conducted some clever experiments regarding the scanning of mental images. The quick and dirty version goes as follows: imagine a map of the United States, and zoom in on New York City. Now imagine a small black dot hovering above the city. When you are ready, zoom that dot over to Los Angeles. How long did it take you to mentally scan across your mental image of the map? This is referred to as mental chronometry, or measuring how long it takes to perform mental operations such as scanning a mental image.\nInstead of a map of the USA, participants were shown the map in Figure 2 and given practice mentally imaging the map. Specifically, they were given practice drawing the map from memory until they could reproduce it to a high degree of accuracy. The map shows an island with a hut, tree, rock, well, lake, sand, and grass, all spread about the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Kosslyn’s participants used cartoon maps like this in his mental scanning experiments.\n\n\n\nAfter the map was removed, participants were asked to recall it in their minds. Then, they completed trials in which they focused on one location of their mental image of the map (some form of a black dot) and then mentally scanned to a different location by moving it. For example, they would focus on an item such as a tree and scan to grass (a longer distance); or focus on a hut and scan to a lake (a shorter distance). The researchers measured the time taken to make each scan in order to assess how the amount of time to mentally scan from one imagined location to another varied depending on the distance between the imagined locations.\nBefore examining the data, let us consider three potential hypotheses of how this experiment could have turned out. The first, which I refer to as the “no-time” hypothesis, proposes that people can scan between different locations immediately without any delay. The second hypothesis, the “random-time” hypothesis, suggests that people will take a random amount of time to scan between the locations. Finally, the “distance-time” hypothesis suggests that the people’s scanning time will increase with the distance between the locations. Figure 3 displays predictions for each hypothesis. This illustrates examples of how the results could have turned out according to each hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hypothetical results of the mental scanning task for the no-time, random-time, and distance-time hypotheses\n\n\n\n\nEach of the panels shows a scatter plot of possible results. The y-axis (vertical axis) represents the amount of time in seconds and ranges from zero to two seconds. Dots that are near the bottom of the plot represent shorter scanning times, and dots closer to the top represent longer scanning times. The x-axis (horizontal axis) represents the distance between locations in centimeters on the real map that participants saw before they had to imagine it. Dots closer to the left of a plot represent scanning times between locations that were close together, and dots closer to the right side represent scanning times between locations that were far apart.\nThe “no-time” plot shows all of the dots in a line at the bottom, which represents 0 seconds. This is what would happen if people could instantaneously scan from any location to any other location. Even though some locations would be closer together or further apart (represented by the fact that there are dots that go all the way from 1 cm to 15 cm), all of the scanning times would be 0.\nThe “random-time” plot shows dots spread around randomly. When I created this graph, I instructed my computer to select random numbers. This reflects the scenario where individuals take varying amounts of time to scan between locations, but the duration is unpredictable and does not correlate with the distance between the locations.\nFinally, the “distance-time” plot shows dots in a tilted line (going from the bottom left to the top right), indicating a positive correlation between distance and time. This could occur if the distance between imagined locations affects scanning time in a systematic manner. Specifically, this graph depicts a linear relationship, where scanning time increases as the distance between locations increases. Shorter distances require less time, whereas longer distances necessitate more time.\nWhat were the results of the study, and did they look like any of the hypothetical results that we just discussed? The original results are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A screenshot of Kosslyn’s results.\n\n\n\n\nThe dots represent the average scanning times between specific locations for all participants, and they mostly fall on a straight line. To me, the results look most like the hypothetical “distance-time” results. The data points are a little bit noisy, and they don’t fall precisely on the line every time, so there is some randomness or variability in mental scanning time too. But overall, people took longer to scan between imagined locations on the map as the distance between the locations increased.\nBefore considering what these results could mean for theories of mental representation, let’s note that this study made an attempt to advance how mental imagery could be investigated using more objective behavioral measures. In this case, the measurement of time to make a mental scan was directly observable. Although directly observable measures of behavior have many desirable properties, including the possibility that multiple observers can mutually confirm and reach a consensus on what they are observing, there are also significant limitations when it comes to cognition. The most significant limitation is that direct measures of behavior are not direct measures of cognitive processes. The assumption is that cognitive processes are involved in producing the behavior in question, and that measures of behavior therefore indirectly reflect the underlying mechanisms of the mind causing the behavior. So, when someone measures “mental scanning time,” we are only measuring the time associated with whatever happened during “mental scanning.” The measure of time does not directly show whether or not a mental image is like a picture or a proposition. Instead, a common strategy in cognitive research is to theorize about how cognitive processes might work and attempt to explain how those cognitive processes would result in the observable measures of behavior.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Explaining mental scanning times\nLet’s assume that Kosslyn et al.’s results can be trusted as a fact, and that when people scan a mental image, it really does take longer to scan across longer distances than shorter ones. What does this fact tell us about the nature of mental representation? Perhaps a better question is: How are facts like this one used in cognitive research to generate knowledge about cognitive processes?\nOne strategy involves inventing theories and hypotheses about cognition, and then evaluating whether or not they can predict, anticipate, and/or explain the patterns of measurements found by experiment. If a theory can explain a finding, maybe it is correct. If a theory can not explain a finding, maybe it is wrong and should be discarded. Over time, the process of theory building and testing would lead to a great many discarded theories that couldn’t explain the findings, and what would be left could be plausible working theories that do a pretty good job of explaining the findings. This characterization of how the scientific method incrementally hones in on better explanations connects with issues in the philosophy of science (e.g., Popper, 1959), which I will elaborate on throughout the book.\nLet’s finish this section by returning to the distinction between pictorial and propositional mental representations, and ask whether the pattern of data is consistent or inconsistent with either of those ideas.\n\n2.3.4.1 A pictorial explanation of scanning time\nAre the findings consistent with the assumption that people have picture-like mental representations of visual images? I don’t think this question can be answered without first speculating more about how pictorial representations might work, and how they could lead to the results reported by Kosslyn et al. Here’s a simple metaphorical elaboration: I could propose that mental imagery for visual images is like perception for visual scenes, and that because of this relationship, mental imagery should behave in similar ways to visual perception. For example, objects in visual scenes have spatial distances between them, and, by analogy, mental images of scenes should preserve the spatial distances between imaginary objects. When looking from one object to another in the real world, it takes time to move your eyes, and the amount of time naturally depends on how far the eyes need to move. If the metaphor holds, it is possible that mentally scanning an image will behave in the same way. So, my answer is yes. The findings could be consistent with the pictorial mental representation assumption, but only if I created a story that plausibly established how this assumption would work.\n\n\n2.3.4.2 A propositional explanation of scanning time\nLet’s ask whether the results are consistent with the propositional assumption about mental representations. Pylyshyn argued that Kosslyn’s results can be explained without assuming any role for pictorial mental representations. To consider the propositional assumption, we need to embed it into a working hypothesis about how people use propositional knowledge. First, consider how propositions could be used to code relations between objects in the scene. For example, sentences can be used to combine abstract symbols (words) to represent relations between objects in the scene.\n\nThe island contains objects\nThe rock is on the north end of the island\nThe grass is on the north-west side of the island.\nThe grass is south-west of the rock\nThe tree is south of the grass, in the southwest of the island\nThe well is due west of the tree\nThe hut is just south of well\nThe lake is close to the tree, just to the southeast\n\nThe next step is to consider how people might rely on propositions during the mental scanning task. For example, maybe the time to mentally scan between one object and another actually reflects the time it takes to activate knowledge about different objects in the propositional network. Lake and tree are close in the image, but they are also coded together in the same proposition, which could make it easier to go from the lake concept to the tree concept. Similarly, the rock is far from the tree in the image, but the way it was written in the propositions, rock is not directly coded in relation to the tree, but that relation can be established by moving through multiple propositions: the tree is south of the grass, and the grass is south-west of the rock. It might take more time to scan longer distances in the mental image due to the requirement of processing multiple propositions.\nAs an aside, given that we have learned about aphantasia (people with no mental imagery), I wonder how aphantasics would perform in Kosslyn’s task–if mental imagery is not required to perform the task, maybe they would be just fine and show the same results as everyone else…or maybe they would refuse to do the task because they would be unable to imagine the map.\n\n\n2.3.4.3 Evaluating the explanations\nNear the beginning of this chapter I suggested that the cognitive sciences are interested in explaining how cognition works. Throughout this book we will examine how the research process is used to construct explanations about how cognition works. In the mental imagery debate that we just covered we saw an approach to explanation that is common in across cognition. This approach involved generating potential explanations that explain existing facts, and that have unique implications that can be tested with further experiments. One potential explanation suggested that mental imagery has a representational format that is analogical to perception. Another explanation suggested that mental imagery has representational format that is wholly different from perception. At the end of this chapter we haven’t resolved the question, and that’s OK. The major takeaway was to illustrate aspects process used by the cognitive sciences to drive research toward an answer.\nIf you were to find me in the hallway and ask me to give my opinion, I’d say that both perspectives on the format of mental imagery are important, and they may not be mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Society and Historical context\nOne outgrowth of the mental imagery research we discussed was the creation of the website aphantasia.com, where many people from across the world are creating an online community to discuss and learn more about their own extreme differences in mental imagery abilities. This is a great example of people being interested in how their own cognition works, and wanting to learn more about it. For me personally, I think it would be great if research into mental imagery could help me to increase the amount of control I have over the vividness of my mental imagery. Maybe continued research on this topic will lead to discoveries on this issue. That could be a positive development for me and other people interested in controlling the vividness of their mental imagery.\nAs I mentioned before, research into cognitive abilities has not always had uniformly positive implications for society, and there are examples where its applications were severely destructive for some groups of people. For example, recall Sir Francis Galton? In 1880, he published the first study showing evidence for individual differences in mental imagery. Mental imagery is a fascinating topic concerning how people experience their own mental life. You might assume that Galton was interested in answering questions like, “How does mental imagery work?” Perhaps this was part of Galton’s motivation for running the study. But, I have purposefully been silent so far about other reasons why he ran the study. He tells us the main reason at the beginning of his paper, which reads:\n“The larger object of my inquiry is to elicit facts that shall define the natural varieties of mental disposition in the two sexes and in different races, and afford trustworthy data as to the relative frequency with which different faculties are inherited in different degrees.”\nGalton was trying to measure differences in mental imagery between people. What was going on at the time that led Galton to ask his questions about mental imagery? How did his results and larger research program influence society? Unfortunately, I should warn you that if you do not already know the answers to these questions, you may find the history disturbing, I know I did.\nI mentioned earlier that Galton was in the United Kingdom, and that some of his ideas tended to spread among psychologists in other countries. Galton is famous for many things because he happened to make contributions in many different fields. For example, he is involved with inventing the statistical concept of correlation (Galton, 1889; Stigler, 1989). He was interested in correlation because he was interested in inheritance, especially the idea that children inherit mental abilities from their parents (Galton, 1890). And, Galton was interested in the inheritance of mental abilities because he was also the father of the eugenics movement (Galton, 1865, 1869). Eugenics became a world-wide social movement partly interested in “improving” society across generations through selective human breeding programs.\nSo, perhaps stranger than fiction, one reason Galton was measuring individual differences in mental imagery ability was to aid his eugenics movement. Mental imagery and intelligence were prized traits by Galton. One of his ideas was to create tests, like those that quantified mental imagery ability, that could be used to help classify people into having superior or inferior abilities. The results of the tests could then be used to encourage people with “superior” traits to breed together, and discourage or prevent people with “inferior” traits from breeding together. The eugenics movement thought that breeding humans in this way would produce super humans across generational time. These ideas turned into eugenics programs, promoted scientific racism, and social policies that spread around the the world and caused numerous injustices, human rights violations, and atrocities.\nIn this mental imagery chapter we bounced from the 1880s to the 2020s, and then went back to the middle and filled in a few ideas that played out in between. In the coming chapters we are going to go continue to discuss historical and current aspects of cognitive psychology. When we look at cognitive research conducted in the late 1800s to early 1900s, a major focus was on cognitive testing. The development of tests to measure mental abilities was deeply inspired by the eugenics movement. Additionally, during that time, many psychologists were members of eugenics movements and conducted research to forward aims of that movement. I don’t think it is possible to make sense of early cognitive psychology without understanding how major strands of the discipline were motivated by the eugenics movement. I review this background in the next chapter, and then connect it with psychological research into cognitive abilities and intelligence testing in the following chapter.\n\n\n2.5 Appendix\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Glossary\n\n\nAphantasia\nA term describing people who report experiencing very little to no mental imagery.\n\n\nExploratory research\nExploratory research refers to a type of cognitive research that aims to gain a preliminary understanding of a particular topic or phenomenon. This type of research is primarily used to generate hypotheses or research questions, and is characterized by its open-ended nature. The main goal of exploratory research in cognition is to identify areas that may require further investigation and to gain a deeper understanding of how individuals perceive and process information.\n\n\nHyperphantasia\nA term describing people who report experiencing extremely vivid and life-like mental imagery.\n\n\nIntrospection\nThe process of evaluating one’s own subjective experiences. For example, introspection could involve personally scrutinizing the quality and nature of mental experiences that occur while remembering a previous life event.\nIntrospection was developed as a psychological method by E. B. Titchener, and was criticized by proponents of behaviorism for being too subjective.\n\n\nMental Imagery\nThe subjective experience of imagined sensations of any type, including seeing pictures in your mind’s eye, hearing a song in your head, using your inner voice, and others like imagined smell, touch, or sense of space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 References\n\nArmstrong Jr, A.

    "text": "4.1 The intelligence test race\nThe Stanford-Binet test was among the first so-called “intelligence” tests to be widely adopted and used in America. In 1905, Alfred Binet (1857-1911), a French psychologist, published the Binet-Simon test with his student Theodore Simon (Binet & Simon, 1905b). This paper, published in French, described revised mental tests that Binet had been developing for over a decade prior (Nicolas et al., 2014). Lewis Terman was an American psychologist at Stanford University who helped popularize Binet’s test in America (Terman, 1916), hence Stanford-Binet. Also in 1916, Psychologist Henry Goddard published an English translation (by Elizabeth Kite) of five of Binet’s papers on intelligence testing in a book titled “The Development of Intelligence in Children” (Kite, 1916). The entire book is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the internet archive.\n\n\nAuthor note: My training as a cognitive psychologist mostly skipped over the topic of mental testing, particularly the history and development of intelligence tests. This chapter is an ongoing attempt to organize some of that history and connect it with issues in cognition. I have found the history to be complex and often extremely fraught. Although mental testing is widespread and has numerous proponents and use cases, it is also intertwined with the eugenics movement. The practice of mental testing has negatively impacted marginalized groups. The scientific and social merits/pitfalls of intelligence testing have been continuously debated in domains where mental testing has been introduced.\nIt is convenient to start with the Stanford-Binet test because Terman and Binet represent somewhat different progressive notions (for the time) about how psychological science could and should be used to improve society. These notions involve the nature/nurture debate about the heritability of mental abilities and the implications of that debate for enacting social policy that follow from taking different sides of the debate.\nIn the early 1900s, nations were finding ways to respond to social issues (crime, education, mental healthcare) with social institutions and policies, and academics were discussing how science could make responses more efficient and less resource demanding. As described in the last chapter, the eugenics movement, of which Terman was a strong proponent, billed itself as a progressive movement capable of fixing societal ailments. Social problems were attributed to hereditary influences and solutions included measures that would prevent “defective” people from breeding.\nIn the domain of mental health, people labelled “feeble-minded” were institutionalized and placed under care of the state. Constructing, maintaining, and staffing these buildings took resources; but, from the perspective of eugenics, the investment was worth the cost because the institutions allowed “defective” people to be segregated from society. Segregating and institutionalizing people for crimes or mental health issues was a widespread practice before the advent of mental tests. Proponents of eugenics envisioned mental testing as a new technology that could enhance the efficiency of sending unwanted people to institutions.\nFrom Terman’s perspective (1916), intelligence tests would have benefits for negative and positive eugenics policies. For negative eugenics, mental testing would make institutionalization even more effective at segregating unwanted people from society. For example, in envisioning how testing could be applied to discover hidden “defective” schoolchildren he wrote, “it is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection of society. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency”. Furthermore, intelligence testing could also be used for positive eugenics, by identifying hidden geniuses and grooming them to become national leaders; Terman wrote, “The number of children with very superior ability is approximately as great as the number of feeble-minded. The future welfare of the country hinges, in no small degree, upon the right education of these superior children.”\nBinet did not presume that mental abilities were fixed or inherited and he argued that such presumptions were premature in the absence of rigorous tests providing objective evidence on the matter. Binet was also hired by the French government to address pressing issues in education. For example, without objective mental tests, French schoolchildren were already being divided up into “normal” children, sent to regular school, and “defective” children sent to special schools or otherwise institutionalized. Binet described the existing methods for deciding the fate of children as deeply flawed, arbitrary, open to numerous forms of bias, and a drain on government resources. One of his concerns was child welfare. The lack of accurate testing meant that some normal children were accidentally being institutionalized for the wrong reasons. Relatedly, Binet speculated that education could improve mental abilities, even of “sub-normal” children. Another set of concerns involved efficiencies for society. Binet considered that educational resources would be wasted on children not capable of learning. As a progressive, he also envisioned a high-functioning utopian society where science was able to accurately test every person for their aptitudes, and then assign people to tasks in society with utmost efficiency (Binet & Simon, 1908). But, those lofty ideas could not be accomplished without a scientifically accurate intelligence test.\nThe race to develop intelligence tests more like a relay race. Researchers were vying to create intelligence tests that withstood scientific and public scrutiny. These tests would be handed off like batons to officials involved in decision-making at the level of social institutions and government. Researchers and practitioners took different sides on the nature/nurture debate and assumed that mental abilities were inherited and fixed at birth, or flexibly acquired over development. These assumptions tinted the interpretation of test results, and biased decision-making and implementation of social programs. For example, what should happen to children who are graded as mentally inferior according to an intelligence test? A eugenicist and hereditarian might argue that these children should be institutionalized and refused education because they were genetically incapable of learning, would never contribute to society, and worse, would further pollute the gene pool if they had children. Alternatively, psychologists like Binet were open to the possibility that mental abilities could be developed and acquired with experience, and that education systems could be improved to meet the needs of children with low to high mental abilities. The next sections explore iterations of research that culminated in Binet’s intelligence test, followed by examples of how the tests were applied in the United States.\n\n4.1.1 Cattell’s mental tests\nGalton’s research on individual differences in the vividness of mental imagery from 1880 was an early attempt to measure mental abilities associated with intelligence. Galton’s work, including his eugenics ideas, inspired many psychologists to continue developing mental tests. For example, James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) published “Mental tests and Measurements” in 1890 (CATTELL, 1890). Cattell made numerous other contributions to American psychology, and continues to be honored by the Association for Psychological Sciences (APS) through their “James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award” for lifetime achievement. Like Galton, Cattell was also a proponent of eugenics.\nHere is the first paragraph from Cattell’s paper:\n\n“Psychology cannot attain the certainty and exactness of the physical sciences, unless it rests on a foundation of experiment and measurement. A step in this direction could be made by applying a series of mental tests and measurements to a large number of individuals. The results would be of considerable scientific value in discovering the constancy of mental processes, their interdependence, and their variation under different circumstances. Individuals, besides, would find their tests interesting, and, perhaps, useful in regard to training, mode of life or indication of disease. The scientific and practical value of such tests would be much increased should a uniform system be adopted, so that determinations made at different times and places could be compared and combined.”With a view to obtaining agreement among those interested, I venture to suggest the following series of tests and measurements, together with methods of making them.”\n\nCattell was also corresponding with Galton to make the tests “meet with his approval” but he only indirectly references the application of mental testing to the eugenics movement (e.g., “indication of disease”), and he mentions several other reasons to pursue the creation of mental tests. In a footnote, he mentions that “the nationality (including that of the parents), and the age, sex, occupation and state of health” should all be recorded when participants take the test”. The inclusion of these measurements is consistent with eugenical aims to show that different races had inherited different mental abilities.\nCattell proposed to measure each person on ten tests:\n\nDynamometer Pressure, (to measure squeezing hand strength).\nRate of Movement (how fast you can move your hand).\nSensation-areas (telling apart two pin-pricks)\nPressure causing Pain\nLeast noticeable difference in Weight\nReaction-time for Sound\nTime for naming Colours\nBi-section of a 50 cm line\nJudgment of 10 seconds time\nNumber of Letters remembered on once Hearing\n\nThese individual tests measure specific physical and mental abilities and none of them measure a complicated concept like human intelligence. At the end of the paper, Cattell lists 50 additional tests for sight (14 tests), Hearing (8 test), Taste and Smell (3 tests), Touch and Temperature (7 tests), Sense of Effort and Movement (4 tests), Mental Time (7 test), Mental intensity (2 tests), and Mental Extensity (5 tests), that he thought should be important for the incoming discipline of Experimental Psychology. Many of the individual measurements later became useful for investigating how individual psychological processes work.\nBy 1896, Cattell had moved from Pennsylvania to New York City and was publishing measurements of Columbia University students’ performance on his mental tests (Cattell & Farrand, 1896). By today’s standards, Cattell’s test might raise privacy concerns about what he planned to do with the data he collected. Cattell reported statistics on hair and eye color, height and weight, head size, breathing capacity, color blindness, vision, color preferences, hearing, pitch perception, skin sensation, hand strength, reaction time, perception of time and space, memory, and mental imagery. In addition, the examiner who administered the test made separate judgments of each student’s qualities (physical goodness, good student, level of intellectual ability, strong-will etc.), based on their professional opinion. Finally, students were given a lengthy questionnaire to report on their family history, medical history, daily behaviors, and preferences (e.g., favorite novel, what gives them pleasure, etc.). Cattell concludes that science should proceed to determine the interrelations between his measurements, and establish how much knowing one thing about a person can predict something else about them. He also concludes that “we must use our measurements to study the development of the individual and of the race, to disentangle the complex factors of heredity and environment”, and that the most important thing that science can do is guide the development of man.\n\n\n4.1.2 Binet’s critiques\nSeveral other psychologists inspired by Galton were also publishing results from their own mental tests around this time, including Hugo Munsterberg (Munsterberg, 1891), J. Allen Gilbert (Gilbert, 1895), and Emil Kraepelin (Kraepelin, 1895). Alfred Binet was among the psychologists interested in mental testing, and well before he published his famous test he published critiques on the existing mental testing literature (Nicolas et al., 2014).\nBinet pointed out that tests were measuring physical ability (like grip strength) and basic sensory abilities; but, rarely measured what he considered higher mental abilities. Binet proposed that individual differences in higher mental abilities could be measured by simple tests, but only if the tests were mentally challenging. He proposed several tests, including the following:\nTests for memory: - drawing a geometric shape from memory - reproducing a sentence from memory - memory for musical notes - memory for a color - memory for 12 objects\nTests for mental imagery and imagination\nTests for attention - duration of attention - size of attentional field - performing multiple tasks at once\nTests for understanding - give a definition - criticize a sentence\nTests for suggestibility\nTests for aesthetic feeling - what are a persons preferences, are they same as artists?\nTests of Moral Feelings; muscular and will power; and motor skill.\nAs Binet might have predicted, Cattell’s initial mental testing program flopped. Cattell tried to demonstrate he could predict students’ grades in college from their scores on his choice of tests, but he wasn’t able to reliably reproduce a predictive relationship. It seemed obvious that college grades should measure something about mental abilities. If Cattell was measuring mental abilities with his tests, then students with high scores should have high grades, and students with low scores should have low grades. Such a positive correlation would provide validity to Cattell’s mental ability tests. However, multiple attempts to show that test performance positively correlated with grades instead showed no consistent correlation. One interpretation was that Cattell’s tests were simply not measuring mental abilities. Binet would go on to implement his own suggestions in developing his mental tests.\n\n\n\n4.2 Binet-Simon Test (1905-1911)\nThis section describes the Binet-Simon test in more detail, including summaries of the five papers translated to English in 1916 (Kite, 1916). Many variations of mental tests have been created since the Binet-Simon test, but this early test still provides a useful example of an “intelligence” test. I quoted “intelligence” because we can reserve judgment on what the test measures until after we look at it.\nBinet and Simon published several papers in 1905. The first paper motivated the need for intelligence testing (Binet & Simon, 1905c). The second paper explained the new method (Binet & Simon, 1905b). And, the third paper provided empirical validation of the approach. This paper described results from the tests that measured in a population of children in school and another group of institutionalized children who had been identified as “subnormal” (Binet & Simon, 1905a).\n\n4.2.1 Motivation\nDecisions about child welfare were being made in France without the benefit of objective tests of mental abilities. Binet observed opportunities for bias in the procedures for making judgments about children that would determine their futures. He thought an objective test would be a valuable tool to guard against bias, and increase the efficiency of how the state spent resources on social programs like education. As a description of the entire research enterprise, Binet wrote, “When the work, which is here only begun, shall have taken its definite character, it will doubtless permit the solution of many pending questions, since we are aiming at nothing less than the measure of the intelligence; one will thus know how to compare the different intellectual levels not only according to age, but according to sex, the social condition, and to race; applications of our method will be found useful to normal anthropology, and also to criminal anthropology, which touches closely upon the study of the subnormal, and will receive the principal conclusion of our study.” (Binet & Simon, 1905a).\n\n\n4.2.2 Method\nBinet created sets of psychological, pedagogical, and medical tests that he used to measure individual differences in children. On the whole, the approach was very similar to Cattell’s, in the sense that both were measuring as many physical and mental features of children and adults as they could feasibly fit into a session where the measurements occurred. The major difference was that Binet had innovated on his psychological questions. Binet had more questions and they covered a wider variety of tasks presumed to involve higher order mental abilities. The questions were also tailored for children at different ages, from 3 to 13, in yearly increments of difficulty.\nFigure 1 shows individual tasks that were determined to be appropriate for children in each year, from 3 to 13. Binet describes the individual tasks in great detail, along with instructions for administering each test, and scoring of each test.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of questions and results from Binet’s mental testing procedure.\n\n\n\n\nAs an example of results, panel B shows the performance of seven and eleven-year-old children on the task “immediate repetition of sentences of 14 to 15 words each.” In this task, a sentence was read aloud to a child who then had to repeat the sentence as many times as possible. Multiple performance measures were taken, including the total number of sentences repeated and notes regarding “absurdities”, occurrences where the child repeated something deemed absurd by the examiner.\nTwo key features of the results were common to all the tests and were crucial to Binet’s method. First, there were noticeable differences in task performance among children of different age groups. For example, seven-year-old children recited fewer sentences than eleven-year-old children. From my perspective, the average seven-year-old in the table (in the middle of the group) repeated about three sentences, whereas the average eleven-year-old repeated approximately five sentences. Second, there were individual differences within children of the same age group. Some seven-year-old children could recite merely one or two sentences, while others managed to recite up to four or five sentences.\n\n\n4.2.3 Quantifying mental ability with Age\nBinet recognized that human intelligence was a large multi-dimensional concept, but he also sought methods to quantify intelligence in simplified terms that would be familiar and easy to use, similar to using a ruler to measure length. Binet wanted a test that used numbers like a ruler for intelligence: larger numbers would indicate greater intelligence, and smaller numbers would indicate less.\nOne of Binet’s challenges was that he had many different types of tests, each providing multiple measures of performance. He wanted to amalgamate the test results into a single dimension of numbers that would be simple, like a ruler. Binet selected age in years. Like a ruler, age is straightforward, progressing in increments of one year at a time. Children also develop physically and mentally as they grow into adults. Binet’s theoretical assumption was that, on average, children’s mental abilities steadily increase each year until they reach adulthood. Therefore, seven-year-olds would have more general intelligence than five-year-olds, and eleven-year-olds would be more intelligent than ten-year-olds.\nBinet invented a relative scale of measurement to capture his notion of human intelligence. The scale was relative to the average age of children. Both adults and children could be measured, and the test would return a number in years. A precocious seven-year-old might have a mental age of eleven, or an adult might have the mental age of a three-year-old.\n\n\n4.2.4 Comparison to Norms\nBinet was well aware that none of his specific tests measured anything as complicated as intelligence. He wrote, “One test signifies nothing, let us emphatically repeat, but five or six tests signify something. And that is so true that one might almost say, ‘It matters very little what the tests are so long as they are numerous.’” (Binet & Simon, 1911). What mattered more than the individual tests was Binet’s innovation to compare test results from one individual to a larger group of individuals. The large group of individuals who had already been tested provided the “norms” for comparison.\nBinet used the concept of average children and assumed that on average children gain more intelligence every year throughout development. Binet’s goal was to assess real children and determine whether they were above or below average for their age. However, average children do not actually exist, they are a theoretical and statistical construct. Binet’s solution was to create real-world estimates of average children by measuring large groups of children at different ages. He measured hundreds of children of different ages on his tests. In this way, Binet obtained norms or standards that could be used for comparison. For example, he gave three-year-olds his tests and recorded how they performed. The data on three-year-olds demonstrated a range of results. Some three-year-olds scored lower, some were in the middle, and some scored higher on the tests. This range of results then became an empirical standard to judge the mental abilities of three-year-olds who would later take the test.\nA parent could have their three-year-old measured on the tests, and Binet could tell the parent how their child performed relative to the other three-year-olds he had measured. Or, if a child was tested and scored as having the mental abilities of a seven-year-old, this would roughly mean that the child performed similarly to the seven-year-olds that Binet had measured while he was developing his scale.\nThe measurement of mental abilities based on a relative comparison to empirical norms is still prevalent in modern aptitude testing like the SAT, ACT, GRE, etc., also known as standardized testing. An intriguing feature of this method is that the norms adjust over time as more measurements are taken. For instance, when Binet published his tests, he had collected a limited number of measurements from three-year-olds, which served as the norms for three-year-olds. However, these norms for three-year-olds would update themselves as more three-year-olds were measured in the future.\n\n\n4.2.5 Computing intelligence scores\nA remaining issue is how Binet ended up computing an individual child’s mental age from their performance across many individual tests. Another way to state this question is to ask how Binet calculated average performance for the children in each age group, and how were the results from new children compared to the results from the existing children in Binet’s database.\nThe answers are that Binet imposed rules for classifying children based on their performance on the tests, and these rules determined how test results were converted into an age in years. Binet experimented with different classification rules and discusses advantages and disadvantages to the scoring methods.\nA potential rule was, “A subject has the intellectual development of the highest age at which he passes all the tests, with the allowance of one failure in the tests for that age. Thus young Ernest has passed all the tests at nine years, except one; he has also passed all the tests at ten years except one; therefore we attribute to him the mental level of ten years.”(Binet & Simon, 1908)\nBy 1911, Binet settled on a more nuanced point system:\n“Here is the rule to follow: take for point of departure, the age at which all the tests are passed; and beyond this age, count as many fifths of a year as there are tests passed. Example: a child of eight years passes all the tests of six years, 2 of seven years, 3 of eight years, 2 of nine years, 1 of ten years; he has therefore the level of six years plus the benefit of eight tests or eight-fifths years, or a year and three-fifths, equaling a level of seven years and three-fifths, or more simply 7.6. This calculation permits the appreciation of the intellectual level by means of a fraction. But it must be well understood that this fraction is so delicate an appreciation, that it does not merit absolute confidence, because it varies appreciably from one examination to another.” (Binet & Simon, 1911).\n\n\n4.2.6 Binet’s use cases\nBinet developed a method that has been used worldwide to measure mental abilities. There are some strikingly simple features of the test that make the method quite compelling. The main idea was to create a vast database documenting how children of various ages perform mental tasks, and then compare new individuals assessed on the same tasks against this database. This would yield a “mental age,” a simple figure that represented mental abilities in relation to a large and ever-expanding database.\nOne of Binet’s use cases was to guard against bias when making decisions about child-welfare. Teachers might send children away to institutions just because they were unruly. Without an objective test of mental ability the teacher could claim the unruly students were mentally unfit for school. Other children may have been unjustly institutionalized, and without any objective way to show these children belong in a regular school, they would be forced to stay in the institution. Indeed, Binet tested institutionalized children (Binet & Simon, 1905c) as a part of his research process. On the one hand, he used results from institutionalized children to further validate his tests and show that institutionalized children had lower “mental ages” when compared to non-institutionalized children. On the other hand, Binet also found cases where institutionalized children were shown to be of “normal” intelligence relative to their non-institutionalized peers. Thus, scores on the tests could potentially be used to save some children from institutionalization.\n\n\n4.2.7 Meaning of the measure\nThe previous section reviewed one of the first so-called “intelligence” tests developed by psychologists, but avoided giving a definition to the word intelligence. So, what is the definition of the word intelligence? Does the Binet-Simon test actually measure intelligence according to that definition? If not, what does it measure?\nOperational definitions are a research tool commonly used in psychology that will can help an evaluation of these issues. Operational definitions are used by individual researchers to specify the meaning of their own terms. For example, Binet could employ an operational definition of intelligence in terms of his own test. Here, the word intelligence would cease to have any common everyday meaning, and would only be used as a shorthand term to refer to patterns of performance on the test. And of course, just calling a test an “intelligence” test, doesn’t mean that it measures the everyday meaning of intelligence. Clear operational definitions can benefit research because they allow researchers to communicate effectively, with clarity, and with terms that are limited to the context of the research. Operational definitions can also cause confusion, especially when researchers choose terms that already have well-established meaning in everyday usage. For example, using “intelligence” as a name for a test could easily confuse people who might assume the name was actually meaningful with respect to the everyday concept of intelligence.\nConsidering how operational definitions work, I can not give a clear answer about whether or not Binet’s test actually measures intelligence. There are two problems. First, not everyone agrees on what intelligence is in the first place. Second, without an agreed upon definition, it is difficult to justify why each component of Binet’s test actually measures some component of intelligence in a meaningful way.\nWikipedia gives the following definition of intelligence:\n“Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.”\nFrom my perspective, the meaning of intelligence is large, varied, and has different meanings for different people, just like the word cognition. As a result, it is difficult for any test to claim that it measures something as diffuse as intelligence. An analogy might be to music. Imagine someone claiming they had a music test that measured whether a given recording had more or less music. Music is so highly diverse that it would be ridiculous (in my opinion) to try to measure all of music on a single scale with a “music test”. Plus, who get’s to define which music is counted as good music? The surrounding issues that would emerge from debates about a such a fictional music test, also surround debates about what intelligence tests mean.\nAlthough I won’t commit to a definition of intelligence, and I won’t claim that the Binet-Simon test measures intelligence, it’s clear that the Binet-Simon test can be inspected and evaluated. It is possible to interpret the meaning of the results based on the testing procedures described by Binet. For example, Binet used a process of trial-and-error to create mini-tests of different abilities that were age-appropriate. Binet specifically designed the tests so that the majority of children in a specific age group could successfully complete their assigned tests as well as those assigned to younger age groups. However, these same children would struggle when attempting tests assigned to older age groups. Also, Binet chose tests that produced variation within an age group–some children of the same age would do better or worse on the same test. Binet measured many children of all age groups on the tests. Then he proposed to compare new children, measured on the same tests, to his growing database.\nSo what does the Binet-Simon test measure? It measures how a child’s performance on Binet’s chosen mini-tests compares to performance on the same mini-tests by groups of children of different ages. This is not a straightforward measure like a ruler, where one inch on the ruler is one inch in the world. Although the Binet-Simon test produces a number in years, that refers to “mental age”; the number is deceiving because it depends on several shifting components. The components include the actual mini-tests that Binet chose, the children that Binet tested to form the empirical comparison group, and the classification rules that Binet used to assign years to children based on their test performance. Changes to any or all of these many components would change how a child would be scored.\n\n\n\n4.3 Mental testing and eugenics in America\nAfter the Binet-Simon test was translated to English, it was popularized in America as the Stanford-Binet test. Many of the American psychologists who would use the new intelligence test were also advocates, members, or leaders in eugenics societies. As a result, intelligence testing was used in America as a tool to further the cause of the eugenics movement.\n\n4.3.1 The Alpha-Beta test\nIn 1917, the same year that America entered World War I, the APA appointed committees to study the situation and prepare for action (Yerkes, 1918) and the National Research Council created a Psychology Committee to examine similar issues (Yoakum & Yerkes, 1920). Many psychologist committee members were proponents of eugenics, including: Robert Yerkes, Madison Bentley, Edward Thorndike, John B. Watson, Walter D. Scott, Robert Woodworth, and Carl Seashore (all of whom would take a turn as APA president).\nWar was a topic of considerable debate among eugenics societies (Kühl, 2013). It was clear that many people would perish during war. On the one hand, according to the logic of eugenics, if “low-quality” people tended to perish, then war could be positive for eugenics because those people would no longer be around to breed. On the other hand, the loss of “high-quality” individuals would be a negative outcome as their genes would also be lost. Furthermore, there was no way to measure the eugenic quality of soldiers and then use that information to determine who would live or die during war. Eugenicists were advocates of using intelligence tests on soldiers to help make personnel selection decisions, such as who would become an officer, and who would have a higher probability of being killed by being sent to the front.\nAmerican Psychologist Robert Yerkes (APA president in 1917) wanted to establish a “mental census” of Americans, and then use that information to improve American society from a eugenics point of view. Yerkes advocated for the testing of all Americans and organized the largest mass mental testing of American men for the draft, administering tests to 1.75 million adults (Yerkes, 1923). There were two versions of the test (inspired by Stanford-Binet). The “alpha” test was created for soldiers who could read, and the “beta” test was created for soldiers who could not.\nIn his 1923 report, “Eugenic Bearing of Measurements of Intelligence in the United States Army,” Yerkes describes the methods and results from the alpha-beta testing efforts and lists these five main reasons to conduct such widespread testing:\n\nIn the discovery of men whose superior ability recommends their advancement.\nIn the prompt segregation in the Development Battalions of intellectually inferior men whose inaptitude would retard the training of the unit.\nIn building organizations of equal or appropriate strength.\nIn selecting suitable men for various army occupations or for special training in the technical schools.\nIn eliminating the feeble-minded.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Scientific Racism\nEugenics ideology typically included racist beliefs about the superior or inferior eugenic qualities of different ethnic groups (Turda, 2010). The Alpha-beta tests of 1.75 million American men produced results that fit existing eugenic ideology about inherent differences in intelligence between ethnic groups. For example, psychologist Carl Brigham, wrote an entire book analyzing the results of the Alpha-Beta tests (Brigham, 1922). He concluded that white Americans had superior intelligence to black Americans and immigrants. He also created dire warnings about the future of America, suggesting that American intelligence was rapidly declining. He warned that although American deterioration was imminent, it could be prevented through public action and laws. For example, eugenically inferior immigrants could be kept out of the country. And, increased segregation of whites and blacks, along with laws against intermarriage could prevent further mixing of the races.\nAs discussed earlier, it is not entirely clear what these so-called intelligence tests measure, or what intelligence itself actually refers to. Nevertheless, proponents of eugenics were quick to claim that results from the tests really did legitimately measure supposedly intrinsic and genetically inherited qualities of humans that made some superior and others inferior. Alternative interpretations, such as the tests measured culturally acquired aptitudes, took additional time to be seriously considered. Racist motivations would continue to daunt intelligence testing in America, and an extended history is beyond the current scope of this chapter.\n\n\n4.3.3 Mental health\nThe eugenics movement deeply impacted public policy and stigma around mental health. The last chapter mentioned that American eugenics proponents successfully petitioned for laws to legalize forcible sterilization of people deemed to be “feeble-minded”. The invention of intelligence tests was heralded as a new scientific tool for the identification of “feeble-minded” people so that they could be segregated and/or sterilized. Psychologist Henry Goddard provides a case example of connecting intelligence testing to the eugenics agenda for treating mental health issues.\nGoddard was director of research at the Vineland Training School for Feeble-Minded Girls and Boys in Vineland, New Jersey. He also arranged for the English translation of Binet’s work in 1916 (Kite, 1916). Robert Yerkes visited Goddard and used his facilities at Vineland during the development of the Alpha-Beta test. Goddard was heavily involved in eugenics, and one illustrative example is from his 1927 article, “Who is a Moron?” (Goddard, 1927).\nGoddard advocated the use of new terms for categorizing levels of “feeble-mindedness” based on intelligence tests. For example, “idiots” had the mental age of two-year old children, “imbeciles” had the intelligence of three to seven-year-olds. Goddard invented the term “moron” to describe people with the same supposed intelligence as eight to twelve-year-olds. The rest of his article describes eugenic ideology in the form of panic about how society is in danger unless it acts to solve the moron problem.\nAccording to Goddard, morons were a problem because they appeared normal, and might only be identified with an intelligence test. As a result, hidden morons passing as normal people were running amok in society, and they also had many children, so they were potentially deteriorating the gene-pool by breeding. He considered extreme eugenic solutions, and wrote, “perhaps our ideal should be to eventually eliminate all the lower grades of intelligence and have no one who is not above the twelve-year intelligence level”, but he also cautioned that eliminating half of society would be impossible and even undesirable. Instead, Goddard proposed that morons could be cured through education, and become very useful to society as workers who would very happily do the jobs they were trained to do.\nAs with Yerkes, Goddard forwarded intelligence tests as legitimate scientific measures of human quality that should be used to make decisions about the welfare of American citizens and their position in society.\n\n\n4.3.4 Education and The Black Psychologists\nThe methods involved in intelligence testing became widespread in education in the form of standardized testing. Similar to previous examples, proponents of eugenics were involved in these efforts. For example, the SAT was created by Carl Brigham shortly after he published his book on “A study of American Intelligence” (Brigham, 1922). The eugenic purpose of the tests was to sort children in terms of their quality, and then give more resources to the education of superior children, and fewer resources to the education of inferior children.\nTesting of American children showed achievement gaps between different ethnic groups. And, to fast forward into the 1960s, there was growing concern among Black Psychologists (only 1% of a primarily white discipline at the time) that educational testing and decision-making policy was harming outcomes for Black children. In 1968, the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) was formed as a national organization during the San Francisco meeting of the American Psychological Association (APA) (for a more complete history see, R. Williams, 1974). The ABPsi was formed both to address needs within the small community of Black Psychologists that were not being met by the APA, and to petition the APA to address many broader concerns. For example, the ABPsi adopted the following statement on mental testing:\n“The Association of Black Psychologists fully supports those parents who have chosen to defend their rights by refusing to allow their children and themselves to be subjected to achievement, intelligence, aptitude and performance tests, which have been and are being used to:\n\nLabel black children as uneducable;\nPlace black children in special classes;\nPotentiate inferior education;\nAssign black children to lower educational tracks than whites;\nDeny black children higher educational opportunities; and,\nDestroy positive intellectual growth and development of black children.\n\nThe ABPsi’s calls for a moratorium on testing (Graves & Mitchell, 2011; see also, R. L. Williams & Mitchell, 1978) in 1969 were not supported by the APA, whose membership also had financial interests in the large educational testing industry. Although there were efforts to maintain a relationship with the APA, the ABPsi became a distinct professional organization and has been publishing its own journal since 1974. ABPsi has been on the forefront of modern research on the impact and legacy of eugenics and racism in Psychology. Finally, although testing is still widespread in America, a moratorium on intelligence testing of Black children was accomplished in 1979 through advocacy of Black Psychologists in California (Frisby & Henry, 2016), where the practice remains illegal.\n\n\n\n4.4 Cognition: Testing abilities vs. testing theories\nThis textbook is aimed at providing an overview of research into cognition. One piece of that history involves psychologists who were advocates of the eugenics movement and who created tests of cognitive abilities with the purpose of deploying those tests on society to further the aims of the eugenics movement. The role of eugenics in motivating the need to create tests of cognitive ability, and in spreading the use of those tests across society is not commonly discussed in introductory textbooks. However, the historical context raises important questions about how the enterprise of scientific research contributes to societies that fund it, and we should be mindful of these issues throughout our course. For example, it is clear that psychologists researching human cognition can produce tools of questionable merit that become widely adopted in society and that continue to have positive and negative outcomes for different groups of people in society.\nThe next chapter begins our transition into more conventional areas in cognitive psychology, like the domains of learning and memory. We will encounter more examples of cognitive tasks that are very similar, if not essentially the same, as the mini-tests used as part of intelligence scales. However, rather than testing for the purpose of measuring and classifying the people, we will discuss examples where cognitive tasks are used to test theories and claims about how cognition works.\n\n\n4.5 Appendix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.1 References\n\nBinet, A., & Simon, T.

For example, in addition to developing mental tests, Alfred Binet wrote more broadly about his school of “Individual Psychology” (Nicolas et al., 2014) that was aimed at using measurements of variation in human attributes to make society more efficient. However, the Individual Differences school of psychology was not the only approach to studying cognitive abilities. Instead, the methods of experimental psychology were also used to ask and answer questions about cognitive abilities. Experimental psychologists also developed tests, but they more often took the form of experimental manipulations. And, the results of the experiments were used to evaluate theories about how cognitive processes work. This chapter will focus on associationism and early empirical work on associative learning processes in humans and non-human animals."

First, an achievement of behaviorism was to legitimize human and animal behavior as a topic of scientific inquiry in its own right. In this way, behaviorism carved out space between psychologies focused on intangible mental processes and physical brain-based processes. Second, behaviorism was constructed as a scientific system in the positivist tradition, which adds context to how I will present the goals and background ideas of the movement. Third, there were many versions of behaviorism because there were many researchers who developed and popularized their own brands. Fourth, perhaps because behaviorism was very large (occupying the time of many researchers), it is populated by controversial figures credited with creating and expanding the movement. The core claims and goals of behaviorism continue to have implications for the cognitive sciences and society in general today."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter overviews information processing as a concept in cognition. As mentioned in chapter 1, Ulrich Neisser defined cognition as “all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used” (Neisser, 1967). Neisser’s definition embraces the information processing tradition in cognition. Sensory input contains “information” about the world, and cognition is characterized as the “processing” of that information. However, just like there were many forms and ideas about behaviorism, there are different forms and ideas about information processing in cognition. We will examine the notions of processing stages, information, and capacity limitations, which became popular research topics around the 1950s and 60s.\nSome alliterative themes about cognitive research are also introduced. For example, we begin the chapter with the four Rs, referring to the industrial, technological, digital and “cognitive” revolutions. The first three revolutions introduced many new machines that changed the course of human history. Some of these machines also had an influence on explanation of cognition. In particular, over the decades, mechanistic explanations of cognitive phenomena have been closely inspired by the working elements of machines modern for the time. In this chapter, we introduce the “assembly-line”, “telephone”, and “computer” metaphors of cognition, and examine how the first two technologies shaped the concept of information processing. The computer metaphor will be expanded upon in later chapters."

    "text": "9.1 Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior\nThe period of behaviorism in American psychology had a sizeable influence on the character of memory research that would follow in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. And, it is worth mentioning one of the transitional points between behaviorism and cognitive approaches to explain why so much of this chapter will be about memory for words.\nIn 1938, B.F. Skinner published his book on a behaviorist approach to animal learning. However, Skinner also sought to apply his behaviorism to people, and all of their behavior as well. In 1947, Skinner’s William James lectures at Harvard developed an extension of behaviorism to human language. The idea was that human language involved verbal behavior, and that principles of behaviorism could be applied to the domain of verbal behavior. Just like a science of behaviorism could determine how environmental stimuli could be manipulated to control a behavioral response in an animal, behaviorism could also determine the functional principles controlling the output of verbal responses in people. His lectures were widely circulated in unpublished form, and were eventually published in 1957, in the book “Verbal Behavior” (Skinner, 1957). At the same time, other domains like psycholinguistics were also developing, and Noam Chomsky famously critiqued the prospects of a behaviorist science of human language in his review of Skinner’s book (Chomsky, 1959). One of the issues caught hanging in the balance was whether or not cognitive processes would be necessary for a successful account of language.\nSubsequently, behaviorist and cognitivist research streams emerged on topics of verbal behavior. Skinner’s behaviorist approach to verbal behavior was followed up in behaviorist journals in the 60s, and some research in that tradition continued at a small pace (Eshleman, 1991). In 1962, following a growing interest in verbal behavior from the emerging cognitive tradition (Cofer, 1978), a new journal was created called “The Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior”, and later renamed “Journal of memory and language” in 1985. Many other journals published memory research over that time period, but I am highlighting this journal for three reasons. First, the papers in that journal track several notable developments in memory that we will discuss in this chapter. Second, the journal shows how ideas from the study of associative learning guided the renewed interest in experimental research on human memory. Last, if you ever wondered why memory research uses words as stimuli so often, it might have something to do with the verbal learning and verbal behavior phase of memory research.\nTo make one more historical note, the growing divide between Skinner’s operant behaviorism and cognitive psychology is nicely documented in Blough and Millward’s 1965 review, “Learning: Operant Conditioning and Verbal Learning”. They begin by quoting Kendler saying “In general, learning theorists understand each other much better than did their ancestors of two decades ago. Neobehaviorists, S-R functionalists, and statistical theorists can communicate easily with each other. Skinnerians also find it easy to communicate among themselves”. The paper then reviews operant conditioning research in part A, and verbal learning in part B, with little overlap between the two research traditions. Their review of verbal learning also provides a bird’s eye view of the increasingly wide-ranging empirical and theoretical concerns that was becoming a new era of cognitive psychology. Much of the work revolved around learning and memory.\n\n\n9.2 Memory Methodology\nWe have seen a few different memory tasks in the last chapter. Ebbinghaus memorized lists of nonsense syllables. Bartlett used the method of serial reproduction. Von Restorff had people memorize pairs of items. There was the immediate memory span task, and free-recall for lists of words. Many more memory tasks have been used in the study of learning and memory. Some of these tasks become very popular and generate bursts of research interest. This section describes general properties of memory tasks, and throughout the rest of this chapter we will encounter specific examples of the tasks in action.\nMemory tasks typically involve two phases: encoding and retrieval. Generally speaking, the encoding phase involves the presentation of stimuli for a later memory test in the retrieval phase. For example, there were two phases in the free-recall experiments from last chapter showing the serial-position effect. In the encoding phase, participants were presented with a list of words. In the retrieval phase, participants were asked to recall as many words as they could. The encoding and retrieval phases could also overlap depending on how the experiment was conducted. For example, a participant could encode some items, then try to remember them, then encode some new items, and so on.\nMemory tasks typically involve experimental manipulation of factors in the encoding and retrieval phases. One aim of the experiments is to determine which factors influence performance in the memory task. Another aim can be to test theories of memory processes. For example, some theories may make predictions about the extent to which the factors will influence memory performance. The addition of experimental manipulations can change almost any aspect of the basic task setup.\nSome common manipulations include the following. The kind of information or stimuli presented or learned in the task. Stimuli can be words, pictures, artificial stimuli like nonsense syllables, or sounds, movies, sentences, and more. The frequency of presentation of items. The order of presentation of items. The temporal delay between the encoding phase and the later memory test. Manipulations can also include what the participant does to information during the encoding phase, or how they are asked to remember it in the retrieval phase. If you can think of something that might increase or decrease your ability to remember information, I’d say there is a good chance that a memory researcher may have tried the manipulation at some point in a published experiment.\nMemory tasks also involve different methods for measuring memory performance. For example, in the free recall task, a participant could be given a blank sheet of paper and asked to write down as many words as they can remember, in any order. In this task, memory performance could be measured as the number of words correctly written down. There are other tasks as well, such as the recognition task. In a recognition memory task, the retrieval phase involves presenting items to a participant, and having them judge whether the item is new (not presented in the encoding phase) or old (was presented in the encoding phase). Importantly, memory performance depends on the task used to measure memory.\n\n9.2.1 Issues with measuring memory: the case of recognition\nThe recognition task is a good example to alert you to a common interpretation problem in memory research. The issue is that the choice and structure of a task can easily influence measurements of memory performance. For example, in a recognition memory task the retrieval phase involves a person making judgments about stimuli they have seemn before, and stimuli they have not seen before. Old items from the encoding phase may be presented, and the correct answer is to identify them as old. New items that were not shown in the encoding phase are also presented, and the correct answer is to identify them as new.\nOne of the issues is that participants can always achieve 100% correct on the old items. All they have to do is say “old” for every item in the test, both old and new items. In this case, it would be obvious that the participant was not discriminating between old and new items, because they would also be 100% incorrect on the new items. This thought experiment highlights the fact that the recognition task can involve a discrimination judgment between old and new items. The ability to tell the difference between old and new items is commonly measured by hits and false alarms.\n\n9.2.1.1 Hits, False Alarms, misses and correct rejections\nHits and false alarms come from an analysis technique called signal detection theory (Green & Swets, 1966), commonly used to describe performance in recognition memory tasks. The table below shows the relationship between response in a recognition memory task, and terms in signal detection theory:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD ITEM\nNEW ITEM\n\n\n\n\nRESPOND OLD\nHIT (Correct Answer)\nFALSE ALARM (Incorrect Answer)\n\n\nRESPOND NEW\nMISS (Incorrect Answer)\nCORRECT REJECTION (Correct Answer)\n\n\n\nA hit is correctly identifying an old item as old. A false alarm is incorrectly identifying a new item as old. We will not go more deeply into signal detection at this point. However, the hit and false alarm rates can be used to measure whether a person can discriminate between old and new items. If the hit and false alarms are equal, like 100% hits and 100% false alarms, then the person is not showing evidence they can tell the difference between old and new items. However, if the hit rate is greater than the false alarm rate, like 80% hits and 20% false alarms, then the person is showing evidence they can make the discrimination. The important aspect is that memory performance in the recognition task is assessed with both hit and false alarm, and not solely on the basis of one measure like proportion correct (hit rate).\n\n\n9.2.1.2 Choosing the lures (new items)\nThe discrimination aspect of the recognition task raises the issues of which items to use as lures or new items in the task. Memory researchers sometimes use the word lures to describe new items in a recognition memory test, referring to whether or not participants will take the bait and claim to have recognized the lure even though it was not presented in the encoding phase. The issue with choosing lures or new items, is that recognition performance will improve or worsen depending on whether the lures are easy or hard to discriminate from the old items.\nImagine an encoding phase were you read a list of 20 words that all began with the letter A. Then, in a recognition test you read one word at a time, and were asked to judge whether the word was old (from the list) or new (not from the list). How well do you think you would perform this task if all of the new words also began with the letter A, compared to a situation where all of the new words began with the letter Z? The recognition task would be very easy when all of the new words started with Z, and were obviously different from the words that began with A in the original list. The recognition task would be harder if the new words started with A, and were chosen to be very similar words to the studied list.\nThe take home message from this discussion is that performance in a memory task may not necessarily involve memory processes, but could involve other cognitive abilities and processes that participants use to perform the task at hand. Memory researchers are well aware of these nuances, and are often at pains to experimentally control aspects of memory tasks to rule out confounding processes or interpretations. I raise these general issues of interpretation to encourage a little bit of caution when reading through the next section on memory phenomena. Here we will go through a list of findings from memory tasks. These findings are suggestive of general principles about how memory works, but they also reflect the specific ways that people perform laboratory tasks used in memory research.\n\n\n\n\n9.3 Memory Phenomena\nThe term memory phenomena refers to findings from performance in laboratory-based memory tasks. It could refer more broadly to everyday aspects of memory as well. For example, the feeling of déjà vu is an experience where people feel as though they have lived through a present moment before. This section will focus mostly on laboratory-based phenomena. There are more laboratory phenomena of memory than can fit in this chapter, so I have chosen some that are in my estimation reasonably representative of the very large literature. I will start by reminding you of some phenomena we have already discussed, and then continue with a small laundry list of newer phenomena.\n\n9.3.1 Temporal Delay\nAs we know from Ebbinghaus’ research on the forgetting curve, memory performance tends to decline with increasing temporal delays between encoding and retrieval. Memory experiments often include a manipulation of delay, such as a short delay of 5 to 20 minutes, to longer delays of days, weeks, or months. In general, memory performance is usually worse after longer than shorter delays. But, memory can change in interesting ways over time, and manipulations of delay are known to interact with other factors too.\n\n\n9.3.2 Distinctiveness\nVon Restorff showed that memory for a set of “isolated” items that were all different from one another was better compared to a set of “massed” items that were all similar to one another. In other words, memory performance in her task was better for the distinctive items. There have been many demonstrations that distinctiveness can influence later memory performance, and researchers continue to be interested in distinctiveness phenomena.\n\n\n9.3.3 Serial Position\nIn the last chapter we saw that the order of items in a list (serial position) influenced memory performance in a free recall task. People generally recalled more words from the beginning (primacy) and ending (recency) of the list, compared to the words in the middle of the list. The relative size of primacy and recency effects can also depend on the format of the memory test (e.g., recall vs. recognition) (Oberauer, 2003).\n\n\n9.3.4 Mental Imagery\nIf you remember way back to the chapter on mental imagery, we learned about Paivio’s work showing that memory performance is better for words that evoke more imagery than words that do not.\n\n\n9.3.5 Stimulus effects: Picture Superiority\nNot surprisingly, the format of stimuli used in memory experiments influence memory performance. The picture superiority effect provides one example. As the old saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words”, which apparently works for memory too. Several papers have reported that pictures are remembered better than words, in both recall tasks (Paivio et al., 1968) and recognition tasks (Gehring et al., 1976).\nMore recently, Hockley showed the picture superiority effect extended to another kind of recognition task called “associative recognition” (Hockley, 2008). In this task participants saw pairs of items in the encoding phase. The item pairs were concrete noun words, or pairs of line drawings. In the recognition phase, participants saw word or picture pairs from the encoding phase, or rearranged versions of the pairs. Participants were better at recognizing the old pairs when they were pictures compared to words.\n\n\n9.3.6 Frequency effects\nThe frequency or number of times you encounter an item can influence later memory performance. For example, memory recall can improve for items presented more than once during learning Peterson (1966).\nThe number of times an item is presented during an encoding phase can also influence performance in a recognition task. For example, Hintzman showed a case where item frequency had no effect on recognition accuracy, but did influence the speed of recognition judgments (Hintzman, 1969). However, this was a curious case, and I bring it up to quickly mention the concept of ceiling and floor effects. A ceiling effect occurs when performance is at the top a scale and can’t go upward any further. For example, in Hintzman’s study, participants were close 100% accurate in their recognition judgments for all items. The task was easy enough that they were at the ceiling after seeing an item only one time, and the remaining presentations of the item did not improve their performance, because they were already perfect. A floor effect is the opposite case, where performance is at the bottom of a scale, and is unable to go down further. Even though Hintzman’s participants had near perfect recognition memory, the effect of item frequency was still evident on the reaction time measure. Recognition judgments became faster as the number of item presentations increased.\nAlthough higher frequency of experience generally translates to greater memorability, there are exceptions to the rule. In the previous examples, the frequency manipulation was applied in the encoding phase, and some items were presented more than others before the memory test. What about frequency effects for stimuli like words that have been encountered by participants outside of the context of a memory experiments? Some words occur with high frequency in the natural language, which means you encounter the words fairly often. For example, here are some very high frequency words: the, and, a to, said, in, was, you, but, that, etc. Low frequency words occur less often, and some examples are: aardvark, magnolia, caboose, filament, cassette, harmonize. In memory a task, the words presented during an encoding phase can be manipulated by their frequency of occurrence in the natural language. Interestingly, manipulations of word frequency influence memory performance in different ways depending on the task. For example, in a free recall task people generally recall more high frequency words than low frequency words; however, in a recognition task, people often recognize low frequency words more accurately than high frequency words Balota & Neely (1980).\n\n\n9.3.7 Presentation rate and spacing\nThe role of frequency invites further questions the conditions surrounding the presentation and repetition of the item. For example, for how long is the item presented during the encoding phase? If the item will be repeated again, when will it be repeated? It could be repeated right away, or after some number of other items have been presented. The factors of presentation time and spacing between repetitions both influence memory performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Results from Melton (1970).\n\n\n\n\nThe joint effects of presentation rate and spacing of repetitions are shown in Figure 1, and taken from an experiment by Melton and Shulman (Melton, 1970). The encoding phase varied how long participants viewed each word, and used presentation rates of 1.3, 2.3, and 4.3 seconds. The graph shows that probability of recall goes up as participants had more time with each word during the encoding phase. This experiment also included repetitions of some words throughout the encoding phase. Importantly, the repetitions were separated, or spaced out, by 0, 2, 4, 8, 20, or 40 intervening words. The graph shows in general that recall probability is higher for words presented twice, compared to only once. But, it also shows an effect of the spacing manipulation. Recall was improved for repetitions that were more spaced out compared to repetitions that occurred with fewer intervening events.\n\n\n9.3.8 Retro-active and pro-active interference\nMemory tasks may involve multiple lists of stimuli, or multiple encoding and retrieval phases. Memory performance for a particular list, or performance in one of the tests, can depend on the other lists and tests. These influences are generally termed retroactive and proactive interference, and have been objects of research interest for many years (Britt, 1935).\n\n9.3.8.1 Retroactive interference\nRetroactive interference refers to cases when subsequent learning activities in the future influence prior learning from the past. Retroactive interference can be observed in designs with multiple phases, and is the finding that memory performance for items from a first phase can depend on tasks performed in a second phase.\nPostman provides a clear example (Postman, 1952). In a first phase (called original learning), subjects encoded 24 nonsense syllables and were then given a memory test. In a second phase (called interpolated learning), subjects in the experimental group were given 24 new nonsense syllables to remember, and subjects in a control group read the New Yorker magazine instead. In the final phase, everyone was retested for the items from the first list.\nIn general, everyone was better on the first test compared to the second retest. In other words, everyone forgot some of the nonsense syllables between the first and second test. However, the experimental group showed even more forgetting than the control group. Remember, the experimental group had to learn a second list of nonsense syllables after the first. This second learning is described as “retroactively” interfering with memory for items from the first list. Postman also showed in that more retroactive interference occurred when memory was tested with a recall procedure compared to a recognition procedure.\n\n\n9.3.8.2 Proactive interference\nProactive interference happens when previous learning activities from the past interferes with current learning activities in the present. For example, Ebbinghaus experienced proactive interference as he was learning his lists of nonsense syllables. In this case, his memory for a current list was influenced by the number of lists that he had previously learned.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Results from Underwood (1957).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 from Underwood (Underwood, 1957) shows evidence of proactive interference compiled across several studies involving learning lists of items. The y-axis measures the percent of items recalled for a current list, the x-axis shows how many other lists had been previously learned. The curve shows that recall is very high when few lists were previously learned, and recall gets worse and worse as more lists were previously learned.\n\n\n\n9.3.9 Number of associates and the Fan effect\nPeople have extensive background experience with words as they appear in natural language. Importantly, words in natural language are not like random collections of words often used in memory tests. Instead, words appear in sentences in highly structured ways. One important aspect of the structure is word frequency: some words appear more than others in the language. Another important aspect is word co-occurrence: words occur together with other words in sentences. Some words co-occur with many other words, and have a high number of associates; whereas, other words co-occur with fewer other words, and have a small number of associate. More generally, any item can be paired with more or less associates, referred to as the item’s fan (associated items). And, the size of an item’s fan influences memory processes (Anderson & Reder, 1999). For example, the time to recognize an item increases as its fan, or the number of associated items increases.\nAnderson demonstrated fan effects in a memory test for propositional sentences (Anderson, 1974). Participants studied sentences describing two concepts, a person in a location. Examples are presented in @ fig-9Fan_effect. Across the studied sentences, each concept was associated with one, two, or three facts. For example, the “hippie” person appeared in three locations, “park”, “church”, and “bank” (fan of 3). Similarly, the “park” location was visited by three people, the “hippie”, “captain”, and “fireman” (fan of 3). The lawyer only appeared in the cave, so both had a fan of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Design from Anderson (1974).\n\n\n\n\nDuring the memory test subjects were shown original sentences that they had studied (target probes), or re-arranged sentences (foil probes) containing new pairings of the same people in different locations. Anderson showed that participants recognition time to accept target sentences, and to reject foil sentences increased as the fan for each word in the test sentence increased. A reproduction of the data reported by Anderson is shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reproduced results from Anderson (1974).\n\n\n\n\nAll of the target sentences were studied during the encoding phase. It took longer to recognize a target sentence as the “person” and/or location “words” in the sentence had more facts associated with them. In general it took longer to reject the foil sentences, but it also took longer as a function of the number facts associated with each word in the sentence. So, a “fan effect” was observed for both studied sentences and re-arranged (foil) sentences.\n\n\n9.3.10 Meaningfulness\nMeaningfulness influences memory performance, but the construct of meaningfulness is not as straightforward as some of the previous factors. Two examples of meaningfulness effects in memory are presented below. In general, more meaningful stimuli are more memorable than less meaningful stimuli.\n\n9.3.10.1 The self-reference effect\nThe self-reference effect suggests that relating information to yourself can help you remember it better (Donovan & Radosevich, 1999). The original study (Rogers et al., 1977) had participants encode lists adjectives in different ways to contrast shallow versus meaningful processing of the words. Shallow processing involved judging whether or not the word had big or small letters, or rhymed with another word. The most meaningful task presented adjectives along with the question, “Describes you?”. Subjects simply had to respond “yes” or “no”. The results showed memory for adjectives was highest for the words in the self-reference condition, when subjects had to consider whether or not the word described them.\n\n\n9.3.10.2 Meaningful context\nBransford and Johnson demonstrated an important role for meaningful context to support memory recall and comprehension (Bransford & Johnson, 1972). They had participants read a short paragraph for a later comprehension and memory test. The paragraph is reprinted below.\n\nIf the ballons popped, the sound wouldn’t be able to carry since everything would be too far away from the correct floor. A closed window would also prevent the sound from carrying, since most buildings tend to be well insulated. Since the whole operation depends on a steady flow of electricity, a break in the middle of the wire would also cause problems. Of course, the fellow could shout, but the human voice is not loud enough to carry that far. An additional problem is that a string could break the instrument. Then there could be no accompaniment to the message. It is clear that the best situation would involve less distance. Then there would be fewer potential problems. With face to face contact, the lest number of things could go wrong.\n\nThis paragraph was designed to be difficult to comprehend without further context. Each sentence could make some sense by itself, but as a whole, it may not be very clear what this paragraph is about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Full Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Partial\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Context pictures used in Bransford & Johnson (1972).\n\n\nThe critical manipulation in this experiment was whether participants received additional meaningful context, in the form of a cartoon picture. Figure 5 shows the pictures used in the full and partial context conditions. One group saw the full context cartoon image before they read the paragraph. Another group saw the same image after they read the paragraph. If you thought the paragraph was confusing before, try reading it while looking at this image to get a feel for how it could help support your comprehension of the paragraph.\nAnother group of participants were given the “partial context” cartoon picture. And, two last groups were not given any context at all. The “no context (1)” group received one opportunity to read the paragraph. The “no context (2)” group got to read the paragraph twice.\nAfter the encoding phase, participants were given a comprehension test and a recall memory test. The question was whether or not the presence or absence of meaningful context would influence comprehension scores, and number of ideas recalled from the paragraph. Figure 6 shows the results from the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Data from Bransford & Johnson (1972).\n\n\n\n\nThe comprehension test had a maximum score of seven. The context before group had the highest comprehension score (6.1), compared to all other groups. The recall test had a maximum score of 14. Again, the context before group had the highest recall score (8), compared to all other groups. Notably, all of the groups performed fairly similarly to one another, showing very little influence of reading the paragraph twice, seeing a partial context cartoon, or even getting the full context cartoon after initially reading the paragraph. The conclusion was that, in this case, receiving meaningful context before reading the paragraph was an important pre-requisite for later comprehension and recall.\n\n\n\n9.3.11 Context effects\nHave you ever walked into a room looking for something, and then forgot what you were looking for, or why you had went into the room? And, then went back into the room you came from and suddenly remembered the goal you had forgotten? This is an everyday example of an environmental context effect on memory. In this case, it seems like the room you are in can be a powerful remember of your current goals.\nSimilar effects of environmental context on memory performance have been demonstrated by memory researchers. For example, Godden and Baddeley (Godden & Baddeley, 1975) showed evidence of context-dependent memory in a group of underwater divers. They conducted their experiment at a dive location outside of a normal laboratory context. They had divers encode words in one of two locations on land or under water; and, then they had divers recall words in the same or different locations from where they encoded the words. All of the words were presented as audio using headphones. One group heard the words in a dry environment before they went for the dive; then, half of those divers were given a memory test in the same dry environment, and the other half went underwater and were given the memory test in the wet environment. Another group heard the words first underwater in the wet environment, and were tested underwater (wet) or on land (dry). The question was whether memory recall would be better if the encoding and retrieval contexts were the same (dry-dry, wet-wet) versus different (dry-wet, wet-dry).\nThe results from the experiment are presented in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Data from Godden & Baddeley (1975).\n\n\n\n\nThe divers recalled more words when the encoding and and retrieval (learning and recall) environments matched. For example, they recalled 13.4 and 11.4 words in the matching dry-dry and wet-wet conditions. However, they only recalled 8.4 and 8.6 words in the wet-dry and dry-wet conditions.\n\n\n9.3.12 Generation Effect\nThe generation effect (Bertsch et al., 2007) refers to the finding that generating information yourself can improve memory performance. For example, Slamecka and Graf (slameckaGenerationEffectDelineation1978a?) demonstrated participants had much better memory for words they generated themselves, compared to words they read.\nTheir procedure involved a manipulation during the encoding phase. Participants either generated words or read words for a later memory test. In the generate condition, participants were shown cards with a word followed by a letter, and instruction to help them generate a word. For example, in the synonymn condition participants saw rapid-F, and had to generate rapid-FAST. In the reading condition, participants were shown rapid-FAST, and simply read the two words. There were a few different rules for the generation task, like generate an associate, the category label, an opposite, a synonym, or a rhyme word.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Data from (slameckaGenerationEffectDelineation1978a?).\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the experiment are shown in Figure 8. In all cases, the probability of recognizing a word was higher for generated words, compared to words that were read. They also found evidence that memory was better for generated than read words in a recall task, and in confidence judgments, where people are asked how confident they are about their recognition decisions.\n\n9.3.12.1 Enactment and Production Effects\nEnactment and production effects are similar to generation effects in memory. For example, the production effect (MacLeod et al., 2010) shows that memory can be better for words that are read out loud (produced) versus read silently. And, enactment effects (Engelkamp et al., 1994) shows that instructions are remembered better if they are carried-out (enacted) or imagined-to-be enacted versus not.\n\n\n\n9.3.13 Testing effect (Retrieval practice)\nHave you ever wondered why some experiences are memorable than others? The testing effect suggests that the act of remembering an event itself can make the event easier to remember the next time. The testing effect, also called the retrieval-practice effect, occurs when people show better memory for items they have practiced retrieving or remembering compared to items that have not received similar amounts of practice (Roediger III & Butler, 2011).\nOne demonstration of the testing effect involved participants learning to read, remember, and understand two short English passages from the TOEFL (The Test of English as a Foreign Language) (Roediger III & Karpicke, 2006). There was a learning phase, separated by a 5 minute, 2 day, or 1 week retention interval, followed by a memory test to recall as many “idea units” from the paragraphs as possible.\nThe learning phase involved a within-subjects manipulation, which means that each person contributed data to both conditions of the experiment. In the study-study condition, participants studied one passage for 7 minutes, and then they re-studied the paragraph for 7 minutes. In the study-test condition, participants studied one passage for 7 minutes, and they were given a recall memory test, and asked to remember as many ideas from the passage as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Data from Roediger III & Karpicke (2006)\n\n\n\n\nAfter the learning phase, participants were given a final recall test following a 5 minute, 2 Day, or 1 week delay. The results are shown in Figure 9. The study-study group remembered the most ideas after a minute delay, but they remembered fewer and fewer ideas across 2 days and 1 week. The study-test group also remembered fewer ideas across the retention interval, but after 2 days and w 1 week they recalled more ideas than the study-study group. The take home finding was that the act of practicing remembering, rather than restudying the material, helped people remember more information over a longer period of time.\n\n\n9.3.14 Directed forgetting\nDirected forgetting effects occur when memory performance is influenced by instructions to remember or forget information (Basden & Basden, 2013). For example, Geiselman (1974) had subjects read one sentence at a time for a later memory test. After each sentence, participants were presented with an “R”, which meant they would be later tested on their memory for the sentence; or an “F”, which meant they would not be tested on their memory for the sentence, and they could “forget” the sentence. However, subjects were given memory tests for all of the sentences, even the ones they were told to forget.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Data from Geiselman (1974)\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the experiment are shown in Figure 10. TBR stands for “to-be-remembered”, and TBF stands for “to-be-forgotten”. Using a free-recall task, participants recalled fewer sentences that were directed to be forgotten (TBF), compared to sentences that were directed to be remembered. The general trend was also obtained for other tests of memory, like sentence completion and multiple choice, but the largest difference was observed with free-recall.\n\n\n9.3.15 Summary: Memory Effects\nThe above section lists numerous memory phenomena that have been investigated by cognitive psychologists. This is not a complete list, and the effects here were chosen to give a rough sample of the kinds of experiments and findings in this domain. Each of the effects listed here has been reproduced several times and in various ways. Most of the effects have also received substantial further investigation. For example, you may have not noticed that I did not offer any explanations of the above effects. In most cases, a great deal of additional experimental work has been conducted to test explanations and theories for each of the above effects, and many more. Instead of pursuing these issues in their minute detail, the rest of the chapter focuses on some broader themes in memory research. These include the concepts of memory processing principles, described next.\n\n\n\n9.4 Memory processing principles\nThe above list presents a large number of phenomena that a theory of memory processes could be expected to explain. Although we could spend the rest of this chapter discusses a few theories and models of memory that have been created to explain some of these effects, we will instead touch on some more general memory processing principles. As a sidenote, we will examine another memory model in more detail in the computational modeling chapter.\nMemory processing principles are general rules of thumb for memory. They are not laws, because memory is a complex process and doesn’t always behave in ways that can be described by simple laws. For example, whether or not memory performance will improve or decline under particular conditions is often an empirical question, where the answer is determined by creating the situation and observing what happens. Nevertheless, memory researchers have proposed general principles of processing that appear to broadly characterize several aspects of memory performance.\n\n9.4.1 The levels of processing principle\nIn the 1970s, Craik and Lockhart proposed the levels of processing principle to characterize several emerging patterns of performance that were spread across numerous findings. The levels of processing principle refers generally to the idea that strength and quality of encoding determines later memory. The principle distinguishes roughly between shallow and deep levels of encodings. For example, a shallow level of encoding would involve brief presentations with minimal additional processing, like reading or hearing some words for a short amount of time. Depth of processing at encoding could be increased by requiring additional operations beyond simply perceiving an item. The levels of processing principle suggests that memory is best for information given deep-encoding compared to shallow encoding.\nThe general idea of levels of processing captures several trends in the list of memory effects. For example, the self-reference effect was developed as a general test of the levels of processing idea. In that study, words that were given shallow encoding were remembered worse than words given deeper encoding. The mental imagery, meaningfulness, generation, enactment, and production effects, could all reflect examples where more elaborate or deeper encoding led to better memory performance.\nThe levels of processing principle was criticized for its apparent circularity. The principle was not a theory of memory processes, and did not explain the mechanisms involved in shallow or deep encoding. Instead, deep versus shallow encoding was inferred from measures of memory performance.\n\n\n9.4.2 Context-dependent and Cue-dependent memory\nThere are many ways that memory appears to be dependent on context (Smith, 1994). On the one hand, context effects in memory are a phenomena in need of explanation. On the other hand, they point at a kind of general principle: context matters for encoding and retrieval.\nDuring encoding, the formation of mental representations for new information is assumed to include contextual information. For example, encoding a picture of a face might include mental representations for objects in the foreground, like the face, and the scene in the background. In this case the scene could be acting as the context for the face. The word context is often used very generally, and one thing in general could serve as “context” for another thing.\nDuring retrieval, memory is assumed to operate in a cue-driven manner. Specifically, a cue to memory can initiate and aid retrieval. For example, in everyday life you may have had the experience of “being reminded” of one thing, as a result of thinking or encountering another thing. Similarly, in a laboratory memory experiment, cues presented at retrieval can aid memory performance. For example, people may remember fewer words in a free recall task compared to a cued-recall task, that involves hints related to the words learned during the encoding phase.\nPutting the encoding and retrieval roles for context together, we get the idea that memory performance can benefit from matching encoding and retrieval contexts. If the cues that were encoded as contexts during encoding (e.g., a background scene) are represented at a later time, they can serve as a cue to memory to retrieve contextually associated information (e.g., a face) that was encoded together during encoding.\n\n\n9.4.3 Encoding specificity principle\nThe encoding specificity principle was proposed by Tulving and Thompson (Tulving & Thomson, 1973), and is very similar to the previous principle. Here is the principle stated in the words of the authors:\n\n“In its broadest form the [encoding specificity] principle asserts that only that can be retrieved that has been stored, and that how it can be retrieved depends on how it was stored. In its more restricted senses, the principle becomes less truistic and hence theoretically more interesting. For instance, we assume that what is stored about the occurrence of a word in an experimental list is information about the specific encoding of that word in that context in that situation. This information may or may not include the relation that the target word has with some other word…If it does, that other word may be an effective retrieval cue. If it does not, the other word cannot provide access to the stored information because its relation to the target word is not stored.”\n\nThe encoding specificity principle suggests that the details of how information was encoded in the first place matter for later memory retrieval. This principle is very similar to the previous one, with a greater emphasis on the processing that occurred during encoding, rather than the mere presence of contextual information. For example, according to the encoding specificity principle, contextual information present during memory encoding may or may not play help later retrieval; it all, depends on how the contextual information was encoded. If some target information was encoded in relation to its context, then contextual cues may be useful for retrieval later on. However, if the operations that occurred during encoding did not focus much on contextual information, then contextual cues may not be very useful as retrieval cues later on.\n\n\n9.4.4 TIP/TAP: Transfer-inappropriate and transfer-appropriate processing\nThe last memory principle is called the transfer appropriate processing principle. Sometimes it is also called TIP/TAP, for transfer-inappropriate vs. transfer-appropriate processing. The big idea here is that “cognitive processing” at both encoding AND retrieval matters for memory. In other words, how a person makes use of prior information encoded by memory depends on how the information was encoded in interaction with the demands of present task. Cognitive processing refers very broadly to the things, task, or other operations that a person does during encoding and retrieval. The principle suggests better memory when there is a match between the processing done at encoding and the processing required at test. In this case, the learning that occurred during encoding is appropriate for, and tranfers well to, the task required at retrieval. At the same time, worse memory performance may be observed when their is a mismatch between encoding and retrieval processing. In this case, the learning that occurred during encoding does not transfer well to the task at retrieval.\nThe TIP/TAP principle further qualifies the preceding principles. For example, memory depends on how deeply you encode information (levels of processing), the context around the encoding episode (context-dependent memory), and how the information is encoded (encoding-specificity principle); but, memory performance will also depend on the nature of the processing required by the retrieval task. According to TIP/TAP, previous information becomes more available when retrieval processing conditions match well with encoding processing conditions, and becomes less available when the conditions mismatch. As a result, it is possible for memory to depend on very specific encoding and retrieval conditions. For example, failure to remember an item could be due to a failure of encoding, or a failure to produce the specific retrieval conditions necessary to cue memory for the item.\n\n9.4.4.1 Morris, Bransford and Franks\nIn one demonstration, Morris, Bransford, and Franks (Morris et al., 1977) showed that the tasks performed at encoding and retrieval can influence memory performance. They used a design typical of levels processing research, where subjects encoded words semantically (in a sentence) to encourage deep processing, or in a rhyming condition to encourage more shallow phonetic processing. In general, subjects should show better recognition memory for the semantically processed words compared to the phonetically processed words. The twist in the experiment was to include two different tests of recognition memory: a standard test, and another test involving rhyming. For example, in the standard test, subjects heard an old or new word and responded yes or no (to identify the word as old). In the rhyming test, subjects heard a rhyming cue word, and were asked to judge whether they heard a word that rhymed with the cue word during encoding. For example, if subjects had received EAGLE during encoding, they might be given the word LEGAL as a rhyming cue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Data from Morris et al. (1977)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows how tasks at encoding and retrieval influence memory performance. First, in the standard recognition memory test, the proportion of words recognized was higher for the semantic (.84) compared to rhyme (.63) encoding conditions. This result is in line with the levels of processing idea that words given deeper semantic encoding should be easier to remember than words given shallow phonetic encoding. However, looks what happened to memory performance in the rhyming test condition. In this case, rhyming recognition performance was worse for the semantic (.33) than the rhyming (.489) condition. In this case, the memory test involved cognitive operations related to rhyming, which apparently made it easier to remember words that were encoded with rhyming related operations compared to words that were not.\n\n\n\n\n9.5 Procedures of Mind\nIn the next chapter on implicit cognition we will continue to discuss some aspects of memory, including implicit influences on memory and learning. As a transition to those themes, I end this chapter with a skill-based memory framework that provides an interesting perspective on themes we have just finished talking about, and the ones we will discuss next.\nProcedures of mind refers to a paper by Kolers and Roediger in 1984 (Kolers & Roediger, 1984) that outlines a skill-learning and task-based view of cognition and memory. The general idea is that cognition can be understood in terms of tasks that people perform, and the collections of specific skills they learn to perform the tasks. The collections of specific skills are termed “procedures of mind”. In this framework, a major problem for cognition is to understand how skill-learning in one situation or task transfers to other tasks and components of tasks. To provide a concrete example we will consider some of Kolers research on reading words upside down.\n\n9.5.1 Kolerian Reading\nPaul Kolers (Roediger III & Craik, 1987) (1926-1986) published several papers over his career on phenomena associated with learning to read geometrically transformed text. Figure 12 shows some examples of rotations and mirror inversions to text. If you try reading each of the sentences, you may notice that some of the transformations are easier to read and others are harder to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Examples of geometrically rotated text from Kolers & Roediger (1984).\n\n\n\n\nKolers ran many kinds of experiments where people practiced the skill of reading geometrically transformed text (Kolers, 1976a, 1976b). Several of his important findings are illustrated by the learning and transfer curves in the next graph. In this experiment (Kolers & Magee, 1978), participants practiced reading text for up to 7 one hour long sessions. They all received the exact same text, however one group practiced reading words out loud, and the other group practiced naming the letters in each word out loud.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Results from Kolers & Magee (1978).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 shows the results. A first important finding was that people get better at both tasks with practice. Everyone struggled to read the inverted words and letter at the beginning, but they all got faster as they practiced more passages.\nThe second and more important finding was that people showed some general and some selective skill learning. In particular, the task of reading text or naming letters appeared to change the kinds of skills that were learned. And, each task required some similar and some different skills. As a result, learning from one task transferred to another in different ways.\nAfter learning 15 passages, the participants in the naming letters conditions (white dots) were transferred to the reading text condition. The skills they acquired while letter naming positively transfered to the task of reading words. For example, the black dot at passage 16 had a reading time comparable to the reading time after 4 passages from the reading text group. This result showed that practice with letter naming of rotated text generalized to reading whole words of rotated text.\nHowever, the reverse pattern of generalization was not obtained. For example, at the very end of the experiment there was another transfer test. The most striking result is from the reading text group (black triangle) who had been reading text the entire time, and were never asked to try the task of naming letters until the very end. They showed minimal transfer to the letter naming task (white triangle). Although the group had read 25 passages, and were very fast at reading rotated words, those skills were equivalent to having practiced letter naming for two or three passages.\nThe two skills of letter naming and word reading seem very close, and although there is some overlap between them, people also learn unique sets of skills to recognize the unique details of rotated letters versus words. And, as we will see in other examples of skill-learning in later chapters, it is fairly common for skill-learning to be highly specific and fail to transfer from one situation to another.\n\n\n\n9.6 Appendix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.1 References\n\nAnderson, J.

The individual .rmd files for each chapter could be edited for content and style to better suit your needs.\nIf you want to contribute to this version of the textbook, you could make pull requests on GitHub, or discuss issues and make requests on the issues tab.\nNote to self to come back here with a quick video rundown of this process."
