Furthermore, intelligence testing also used positive eugenics, identifying hidden geniuses grooming become national leaders; Terman wrote, “number children superior ability approximately great number feeble-minded. future welfare country hinges, small degree, upon right education superior children.” Binet presume mental abilities fixed inherited, argued presumptions human intelligence premature absence rigorous tests providing objective evidence matter.

Binet saw existing methods deciding fate children deeply flawed, arbitrary, open numerous forms bias, drain government resources. One set concerns involved child welfare. lack accurate testing meant normal children accidentally institutionalized wrong reasons.
